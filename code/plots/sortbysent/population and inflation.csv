0,"It seems to me that you are demonstrating how absolutely meaningless the general GDP statistic is.  We know GDP is growing and we know the top 1% are benefiting most from the growth.  So what does it even mean to say our economy is growing, while we use a meaningless statistic like GDP to measure the growth, without relating it to the average citizen in that economy?<br/><br/>Rather than using GDP per working-age adult as a measure of a growing economy, why not use something like a (growth in GDP/ growth in median income) ratio?  Far better to have a small growth in GDP that produces a big growth in median income, than a big growth in GDP that produces a small or no growth in median income.<br/><br/>Of course the whole idea of measuring the health of our society by the ""things"" we have, is an issue for a different discussion.",0.9706
1,I have a policy with United Health Care that is grandfathered.  The premiums have had increases over 10% per year prior to the health care law being passed.  The premiums have had increases in excess of 10% per year after the health care law was passed.<br/><br/>My premium for the next 12 months is a 17% increase starting in July 2015.<br/><br/>I have not seen a change in the premium inflation rate.  The health care law does not appear to cause my rates to go through the roof or cause a reduction in the rate changes.<br/><br/>Actually I am surprised that the request of the insurance companies are as low as they are based on my premiums.,0.9493
2,"I've always thought that Keynes was most interested in employment, and he thought that a decline in spending will diminish employment.  In contrast, classical economics at the time said a decrease in spending will tend to lower the rate of interest and an increase in investment to raise it.  'But if what these two quantities determine is, not the rate of interest, bu the aggregate volume of employment, then our outlook on the mechanism of the economic system will be profoundly changed.'  Keynes considered this of 'overwhelming practical importance.'  That's the end of Chapter 14.  Keynes was arguing, I think, that the most important metric to consider is aggregate employment.  I think this is why Keynes looked so favorably on fiscal tools like direct government spending/investment.",0.9258

4,Interesting analysis .. Then perhaps the proper adjustment would be to set minimum wage to 0.6 of current median wage .. And then to use local metro inflation rate to adjust rate up on an annual basis .. Or something like that .. Could help rural areas recruit biz as they might move to obtain lower wage 'rates' .. At the very least excellent food for thought .. Thanks!,0.9165

7,"I am afraid I cannot solve this without the need of a computer program. But the method would be as follows:<br/><br/>The bus number is known and hence the sum of the children’s ages is known. So generate for each possible sum (this is equal to the entire positive number line), all the combinations of the numbers (based on number of children which is checked from 2 to the bus number itself) that add to the bus number.<br/><br/>Suppose, the bus number is 8000. Generate from two children to 8000 children (of age 1 year each), numbers that add to 8000. For each combination find the product.<br/><br/>Since, knowing the age of wizard and thus product of ages and the number of children is not enough, the sum-product pair must have more than 1 combination of children’s ages. <br/><br/>So reduce the sums that meet the above criteria for a fixed number of children. From, the last statement, it is imperative that for that sum, the product is the same for all the combinations of numbers and thus the Wizard’s age is known.

That's an entirely different discussion. It likely has to do with a combination of social expectation -- I remember a fellow physics major telling me in the 1970's that her parents were pressuring her to switch to French literature -- and the fact that while male and female IQ's are on average only 4 points apart, fewer women are at the IQ extremes, both high and low -- and physics is the highest IQ field. Also the fact that women have, on average, higher verbal and social intelligence, but lower spatial and mathematical intelligence, reducing the number who are suited to the STEM fields.<br/><br/>But, of course, in the current climate of social McCarthyism that can't even be said by an academic -- Larry Summers lost his job merely for mentioning some of the scientific results as a possibility.

It's there simply to provide a mental image of how things work. Laffer is absolutely correct is saying that, depending on where your starting point is on the curve, it might be that a reduction in the tax rate could produce an increase in revenue. The trouble is that without numbers to relate the curve to the actual empirical situation, we can't tell if that will be the result, because if your starting point is to the left of the global maximum then any reduction in the rate will obviously and necessarily reduce revenue. The ""global maximum,"" by the way, is the point at the top of the curve -- moving either way from that point is going to reduce revenue. In the case of wages, in the absence of monopsony, neoclassical economics would assume that the market wage is always optimum, but they rule out monopsony and monopoly in their axioms. In the case of Laffer's curve, I think the optimum top marginal rate would be at least 70%, and we have historical data that suggests it might be 90%, but of course Laffer and the supply siders refuse to admit the possibility that they are already far to the left of the global optimum.",0.3081

Debts are unimportant because they can be offset by future economic growth.<br/><br/>Keynes was indeed a genius.  HIs prescription for focusing on increasing aggregate demand worked in the first Great Depression which started in 1929 because many of the developed countries still had abundant resources.<br/><br/>But in the meantime overpopulation has put a strain on available resources around the world.

The slow pace of recovery from the economic shocks of 1973-74 was due in part to the Administration's concern for inflation being greater than its concern for unemployment.<br/><br/>President Carter increased emphasis on reducing unemployment and adopted a more expansionary policy.  As a result, unemployment in 1978 averaged only 6.0% -- still high for that era but an improvement.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in 1978-79 the recovery was hit by a food-and-fuel scarcity crisis worse than the previous one.  Giving priority to preserving jobs, Carter’s policy accommodated the cost push and inflation was allowed to rise substantially.<br/><br/>It was at that point that Carter gave the efficient-markets hypothesis its historic chance, bringing in Paul Volcker who implemented a disinflation policy that hopefully would spare the real side of the economy.  Efficient markets flunked, but the blame fell on Carter.

104,@Dan Romig<br/> Minneapolis MN<br/><br/>Wouldn't we all but it's NOT for very good reasons inseparable from the worst economic crash since the 30's. The question then arises whether a $17 trillion dollar plus economy with one of the smallest tax takes in the world is capable of handling its current debt burden and does it make sense to borrow more now when interest rates are exceptionally low to invest in infrastructure (which act in and of itself will increase GDP and thus the tax take) or borrow later at higher rates. Currently the deficit is running at about 2.7% of GDP which is about the average for the last 50 years. I'd have said it was a no brainer myself. And btw Singer's description of the accounting involved in QE and the consequent expansion of the Fed balance sheet is essentially correct. This is a positive process from the point of view of ordinary Americans. ,-0.9264

In fact, that last 5% figure was the lowest unemployment rate ever achieved during the 1980s.  But note how much higher inflation was back then and that it was steadily rising well before the low in the unemployment rate.<br/><br/>During the Clinton presidency unemployment fell to 3.9% in October 2000 and yet again this low was also preceded by a period of rising core inflation, albeit from a much lower level than in the 1980s.  During the W. Bush years in March 2007 the unemployment rate fell to 4.4% but this time inflation had already gone above 2% in September of 2004 and stayed there for the next 3 years in a row.  Now look how the current situation contrasts with those previous periods.  Today, inflation has been falling, not rising, and still remains well below 2% even as the unemployment rate is nearing 5%.<br/><br/>George H.W. Bush was fond of blaming the Fed for not winning a second term but clearly inflation was much higher during his time at around 4% for the core PCE deflator.  Today, the Fed really has no reason whatsoever to even consider hiking rates but may do so anyway and precipitate a completely avoidable breakdown in the current recovery.",-0.9838
