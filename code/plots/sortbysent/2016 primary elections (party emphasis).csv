0,"Not mentioned but needs to be......the incredibly low voter turnouts. Rick Perry won his last election in TX with 20% of eligible voters voting for him. Only 39% of eligible voters actually turned out to vote. Even fewer came out to vote for Greg Abbott. The TX Dem party cannot even field a complete slate of candidates, there were more Green candidates running in the last two statewide elections that Dem candidates. Of course, political scientists have long known small voter turnouts are positively correlated with conservative victories which is why the GOP has long advocated for voter suppression techniques. The one that seems to work best in TX is to portray state government as a long running clown show. So, yes, a TX conservative has no problem with the state government's complete dependence on federal largesse, just as long as some political promises to ""cut his taxes"". Whether or not that ""tax cut"" manifests in reality is another story.",0.988
1,"Except that Obama won a second term.   So it wasn't just about the Bush presidency.   Furthermore, the demographics and political allegiances in this country are going to continue to put a Democrat in the White House almost regardless of who the candidates are.   All the large states except Texas are going to vote Democratic.<br/><br/>For 2016, there are 9 tossup states (all states that Obama won in 2012).   Without those, the Dems already have 232 electoral votes.    They need just 38 more to win.   If they win Florida, they only need 9 more from the 8 remaining states.    The only chance the Republicans have is if they can win BOTH Florida and Pennsylvania (PA not being one of the tossup states).    Without that, there's no realistic path to the White House for the Republicans.    The House, Senate and Gubernatorial seats are another matter. <br/><br/>Furthermore, just because someone honestly says what they believe doesn't make them a good candidate for anything.   You can be totally honest and still be an intellectual idiot with no understanding of history or international relations.   Trump probably doesn't even understand that the presidency is not like being a CEO and that he would have to go to Congress for practically anything he wants to do.    How much support would he have in Congress after he's alienated both political parties?   He'd get even less support than Obama has.",0.9879
2,"Mr. Martin is spot-on in describing the ""Democrats' shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity."" This, in a nutshell, is why so many working-class voters (esp. whites) vote Republican; they justifiably believe that the Democratic party has by-and-large abandoned them and their economic well-being. What have the Democrats done over the past several decades, if not to prevent, then at least to ameliorate the effects of globalization and outsourcing on the middle and working classes of this country and the hollowing out of the Rust Belt and Appalachia? Not nearly enough, that's for sure. <br/><br/>That is why I am intrigued by Jim Webb's presidential candidacy. He, more than anyone else, represents a ""back to basics"" Democrat focused on a message of increased economic mobility AND on the importance of spreading this message to culturally conservative areas, such as West Virginia, Kentucky and most of the South, which have turned away from the Democrats in recent years because of the party's focus on cultural liberalism to the seeming exclusion of almost everything else. If the Democratic Party wants to be a truly national party with truly national appeal, it needs to get back to economic basics. Otherwise, it will turn into a party which can win only in the Northeast and the West Coast, and that will be nowhere near enough to influence national policy.",0.9809
3,"Republicans seem more than willing to spend millions of dollars far away to ensure others have access to democracy and voting to show the will of the people. Witness all the purple thumbs in Afghanistan and Iraq in the last decade.<br/>Why are they so unwilling to make sure we remove people from the voting rolls here in this country? Seems to me we, including Republicans, can make sure all legitimate citizens can and should vote by sending voter registration buses through out low registration counties to get citizens registered correctly. Need a picture ID? Get one on the bus or at home. Proof of citizenship needed? Experts can find the correct resource. Handicapped? Give an absentee voter form.<br/>We know the answers, we are willing to spend the money far away, why not do the same here at home?<br/>If we are going to spread democracy abroad, we need to ensure it here.<br/>I would respect the Republicans more if their rhetoric was more positive to make sure our democracy worked for all rather than restricting this to increase Republican chances of winning at the expense of fairness and justice for all. Their position is just a raw power grab that reduces the quality and power of democracy and turns us into a rich banana republic. ",0.9793
4,"The GOP shamelessly took on issues like anti-abortion and anti-gay in order to gain votes among a group that turned out to be very reliable voters. The democrats have not had a similar message to sell their voters, a notable exception being ""hope and change"" for Obama. Which turned out to be ephemeral at best. How about this for a Dem campaign slogan:""we will never (repeated 365 times) mess with Social Security or Medicare. These great programs are a sign of american strength and equality and we will protect and enhance both, in the name of our bothers and sisters-- we the people of the united states."" BAM-- elections won.",0.9779
5,"I'll put it this simply, and I do so as one who, earlier in my life, on occasion voted for the GOP candidate - try to name a single program or policy put in place (or even supported) by the GOP over the last fifty years that has benefitted the nation as a whole.  I could fill a notebook citing those that serve the narrow interests of the plutocracy, usually at the expense of the nation as a whole, but cannot recall a single broadly beneficial program.  Perhaps there are some, but I think one's getting a headache trying to recall them is very telling.  And yet they control Congress, and the Supreme Court, and may well gain the White House next year.  Utterly amazing.",0.9776
6,"The 1% or .1% have control of the government. It is their policies that get put through. What we are experiencing is what happens when money controls governance. Maybe you view these columns as simplistic but what is your answer? What can you offer up? <br/><br/>What happened when NAFTA went through? Was it middle class workers that championed this trade deal or the well connected/well endowed? Cui bono? Now we have the TPP. Who is clamoring for this trade bill, negotiated in secret, to pass- the middle class or the well connected/ well endowed? Cui bono?<br/><br/>Perhaps the 1% or .1% are picked on because they use their wealth to rule the nation. Perhaps they are picked on because they fund candidates who then rule for them.<br/><br/>Once again- I ask you what recourse does the middle class have? The 1%/.1% fund the campaigns and control the airwaves with your candidates who are compromised before they even arrive at office. The middle class is duped by rhetoric while behind closed doors both parties give the 1%/.1% everything they want that matters. The well connected/well endowed could care less about gay rights or who can marry. They do care about trade deals and repealing the Glass-Steagall Act. <br/><br/>I ask you again- what is your solution?<br/><br/>Mine is to DEMAND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM.  As long as politicians are bought and paid for governance will be compromised. There is no democracy when offices and airwaves are bought and paid for by the 1%/.1%",0.9721
7,"Our American Revolutionaries who signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776 and then created this great nation were political activists committing criminal acts of treason. <br/><br/>These men committed their fortunes and their lives to the creation of the USA. They would have all been hanged by the English Government if the American Revolution had failed. <br/><br/>Today, politicians are only in the game for their own personal financial gain with bribes and cash in paper sacks for their congressional votes and no-bid contracts from the Public Treasury awarded to their political campaign contributors!<br/><br/>Only those politicians that accept sufficient campaign contributions in return for political favors and no-bid contract awards can collect enough campaign money can get themselves elected to public office. <br/><br/>US citizens, foreign governments, foreign citizens and foreign businesses make cash campaign contributions to politicians only in return for congressional legislative influence and government favors such as Free Trade Agreements, Permanent Normal Trade Relations, presidential pardons for convicted felons, military secret Hughes Aircraft Rocket Guidance Technology export license to Communist China (Google ""Chinagate""), CGI Federal political power influenced no-bid contract awards, and etc. that is paid out of the public treasury or not in the interest of the US citizens! <br/><br/>Some people (including me) might define today’s actions of our elected officials as bribery and treason.

8,"""Obamacare, which was once a conservative idea, is working better than even supporters expected; so Democrats are committed to defending its achievements, ...""<br/><br/>Name the Democrats defending it.  I'd like to see that list of oh, so brave souls.  In Kentucky, the state where the ACA can arguably be said to have been the greatest success, the (fraidy cat) Democratic Senate candidates for last year, the (fraidy cat ) Democratic governor candidate (and all other state offices) this year, won't even mention it, they're so cowed by the GOP's anti-ACA propaganda Democrats have allowed to go unanswered since 2010, and have allowed to take hold as truth in the public's mind.",0.9692
9,"In order to reverse this process it will be necessary for those at the bottom to turn out in numbers to vote for the candidates whose party offers them the most (since both political parties get $$$ from the rich).  If we stop voting for candidates who owe their souls and their votes to the rich and to corporate America the nation might have a chance to halt the strip mining of its wealth by those with money.  At the moment the law allows for way more money to be stripped out for use by the rich than for redirecting it to communal needs like education, infrastructure etc., it collects more money from working people than it does from the total wealth of all citizens.  To change the direction of the law, the nation's voters need to change how they vote.  Change your Representative every two years and they will be less likely to suck up to the rich.  Start a revolution: VOTE and complain if the powers that be disenfranchise you.  THEY sure know enough about picking your pocket.",0.9685
10,"Rima, <br/><br/>You changed the subject.  I don't know why.  But I'll add to my original statement that your statement ""The real issue is which Democrat will get the nomination. Nothing else should matter."" is wrong, too.  <br/><br/>Like I originally said, thinking like that -- taking the opposition lightly -- will get you beat.  We've had nearly two generations of just that, and I simply can't figure out how long it's going to take ""liberals"" to figure this out.  It's not like the GOP doesn't hold power in the greatest majority of governorshipships, state Houses, state Senates, the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate, the Supreme Court, courts across the land, and control the conversation and what people ""know"" about markets, government, and the economy.  <br/><br/>These people -- wrong on everything -- are determining the direction of not just the country but the entire planet.  It'd be nice if my team woke up to the fact that being right just isn't enough.  You have to win.  And that's something liberals/progressives/Democrats seem to place 2nd to being right and whining.  ",0.9657
11,"I would love to be corrected on the impression I got from watching the first majority Black districts being drawn in Georgia, but this is what I saw happening in the late 1970s and early 1980s (and I say this working the campaign that elected John Lewis as Congressman for the district representing Atlanta and much of Fulton County, working in the Julian Bond campaign, I'm a white progressive Democratic-voting Southerner who actively wanted to see full minority participation in Georgia politics):<br/><br/>Black elected legislators actively worked with Republican legislators to carve up the state between ""safe"" majority Black districts and ""safe"" suburban Republican ones.  Now this is not to say that this didn't happen in the absence of white legislators who remained Democrats supporting and trying to help guide a different solution.  But this is what happened from my viewpoint.  Perhaps this was inevitable, but it also seemed like a part of the Southern Strategy to make the South ""red"" that I don't hear many talk about now, three decades on.  That the South now has the end result achieved can't be a big surprise.",0.9654
12,"All this stuff a year in advance and with a time horizon of twp weeks.<br/><br/>We change parties in the White House every eight years, and the Obama presidency has been an economic disaster.   Hillary has been around for 25 years and has been extraordinarily divisive.    She was a Goldwater activist in 1964 and remains the most conservative figure in the party leadership.<br/><br/>ABH (Anybody But Hillary), whoever he or she is, is going to do very well in Iowa.   The person who has positioned herself perfectly is Elizabeth Warren and will do very well after Iowa, if not before.   <br/><br/>To be sure, Warren was and is a Nixon Republican, but that is way to the left of Hillary and Obama.  She will almost surely lose in November, but at least will be a good transition from the 1990-2020 30-year cycle to the very different 2020-2050 one.",0.9648
13,"You can complain all you want about President Obama or Senator McCain but the bottom line is the problem is ""sequestration"" Sequestration has placed caps on spending and preventing shifting budgets around both on the GOP's interest ""the military"" and the Democrat's interest ""the safety net"". <br/><br/>I imagine Grover Norquist and the Tea Party are clapping their hands in glee at this financial handcuffing of the United States, unfortunately the price the US will end paying for this will be extreme.<br/><br/>I'm a baby boomer independent way to the left of President Obama and while I would never vote for him I have nothing but respect for Senator McCain. I guess I'm old fashioned but I like someone that wants to make a deal rather than ""my way or the highway"" which is most of what we've heard from the GOP for the last decade.",0.9599

15,"It occurred to me when Kasich entered the race that he and Rubio would give the republicans a huge advantage in the general election. They could probably count on winning Ohio and Florida, and they would be new faces without the taint of extreme partisanship or crazy rhetoric. But as Bruni suggested, the republican base may be too radicalized to see the opportunity in front of their noses. They suspect Kasich because of his relative moderation and Rubio has a funny name like another politician they love to hate.

20,"The victories for the Democratic Party and for our citizens are reflected in the more evolved policies of our government.  The political victories - distinct from policy victories - may indeed provide an avenue less fraught with bigotry and hate for the GOP if they can avoid the temptation to be bigoted and hateful.<br/><br/>What is remarkable and worth celebrating is the change in political strategy in just a dozen years.  In 2004, the Republicans got measures placed on the November ballot in many states that were intended to enhance GOP turnout motivated by fear of marriage equality.

21,"""Democrats Being Democrats"", has taken far longer to occur than one might have anticipated. Prior to the 2008 Republican spasmodic move to the right,  caused by the McCain/Palin, Tea Party insurgence, the Democrats had a two year window to lead and to act.

Now, it appears that the political pendulum has an arc extending on the far right with a confused and self-harming GOP, and to the further left, as the Democrats return to historical ground.<br/><br/>This regained Democratic pulse places the parties at almost poplar extremes. It has taken quite some time, with  debilitating lethargy, to awaken the Dems, not helped by a truculent, self-isolated President. <br/><br/>Now that each party has returned to their respective corners, the match for the hearts of the country is better balanced, and the forthcoming elections, local and national, may well finally speak to an awaiting nation, thus testing the theories of moderation and political pendulum equilibrium.",0.9201

25,"Dr. Krugman,<br/>I hope this gets included in comments. My past comments have been ignored.<br/><br/>Social Security is considered ""socialism"" by the 1%. Since government might extend ""socialism"" to other activities of the 1%, it is the ""tip of the spear"" to these robber barons (captains of) industry. Progressive economics would harness capitalism leading to reliable life outcomes for Americans, but limiting monopolist business practices, currently condoned by the ""invisible hand of the free market"" majorities running congress. Ending the threat of incipient ""socialism"" by the 1% explains the 1% support you describe in this article. The ""Not my problem"" attitude of the current majority in congress towards the 99% reflects the needs of their donors. The support by the 51% of voters (51% of less than 50% of voters who actually vote = 25.5% of eligible voters) comes from a low-information/high-excitable fearful population of all incomes.

28,"Restricting voting rights isn't solely a matter of race, but part of a broader intellectual movement that distrusts democracy. I say intellectual because its roots lie in a group of highly acclaimed (in some circles) intellectuals who came to America from Germany and Austria. It's understandable that they might distrust democracy based on their own experience (after all, the Nazis were elected to office), but they also distrusted democracy for reasons that are unique to America. In their view, liberal democracy in America will lead to a value-free aimlessness and a hedonistic permissive egalitarianism. They look to not only to ancient philosophers for support for their view, Plato and Aristotle, but to America's founders, who restricted voting rights to those they deemed qualified to determine their representatives in government. This view can be seen in comments that warn that certain voters will support politicians who promise them ""free stuff"".

I voted for Jimmy Carter in my first election.  SInce then, I have mailed a change-of-address to the voting registrar 3 times.  Each time, voting materials were sent to the new address.<br/><br/>Since I was 18, I have voted in probably more than 100 elections at all-levels.

I walk into the polls, announce my name and current address, the poll worker finds me on the list, I sign for the ballot -- and that's it.  There is rarely a wait of more than 10 minutes.  In CA we can even vote by mail, or absentee by mail.<br/><br/>The rules have never changed.  There are no claims of ""voter-fraud,"" no one screaming that voting is unfair, no one asking for a voter ID card.  In California it is about the ""numbers"" at the polls, not ""who.""
