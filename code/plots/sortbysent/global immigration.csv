0,"In response to Mehdi's reply I say the following:  You say I make ""unfounded negative assumption"" about the migrants.  Of course, I can counter that your making ""unfounded positive assumptions"" about the migrants.  But the assumptions both of us make are irrelevant in a larger sense because the central point is there are many good reasons national borders of western Europe should be secured and respected including a shared belief in democratic government, gender equity, the separation of church and state, civil liberties and maintain certain notions of fairness, social and economic justice. These western beliefs evolved over hundreds of years and we all have an interest in having that process continue.  <br/><br/>You say its ""nonsense"" that many of the migrants are unskilled, find notions of civil liberties repugnant, reject the western world's separation of church and state, hold repressive religious views that reject any notion of gender equality, preach violence against gay and trans-gender individuals, risk triggering massive civil, economic, and social disruption in European nations.  Read the U.S. State Department reports on who these migrants are.  In any event, the immigration laws of European nations provide those nations an opportunity to make that inquiry and, it's an indisputable fact, that it's the intent of these migrants to circumvent that legal review.   <br/><br/>In short, all western nations have good reasons and a shared interest in secured borders.

1,"“It’s possible for wealthier nations to … anticipate the continuing waves of displaced people and to shape long-term, orderly ways to help” refugees “settle in new lands, the way many of our parents and grandparents did,” and the way I did.<br/><br/>After the first Arab-Israeli war of 1947-1949, I ended up living in a desolate, little known or heard of, tiny and lost to the world desert Sheikhdom called Kuwait.  I lived in a tent, under hard conditions, and worked for the Kuwait Oil Company as a messenger.  I was 14.  An American missionary took pity on me, helped me attend classes at the British Consulate in Kuwait for two years, after which I was granted a diploma equivalent to a high school one.  I then took a test with thousands of students from India, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and the Arab Gulf states.  I received high scores and secured a full ride at an elite US University.<br/><br/>The “United States, a country proud of its tradition of welcoming ‘huddled masses yearning to breathe free,’ welcomed this once “homeless” and “wretched refuse of” her “teaming shore,” fed him, educated him, embraced him as one of its own and made him a loving and loyal son.<br/><br/>He is eternally grateful.<br/><br/>This great and hospitable land should continue the tradition of its noble creed and should continue to welcome homeless refugees, who will be loyal and grateful and who will continue to make it a more prosperous land and nation.

2,"I'm very happy about the decision, but the ""This means America is the best nation in the world"" narrative that's been creeping up is a bit much. If America wants to be the best nation in the world, they need to start being on the forefront of change, not lagging behind other countries by decades.

3,"Looks to me like WW-III is underway. And there's this, from a fascinating book that touches on so many issues of our time (including the world war in progress right now),  ""Be Revolutionary: Some Thoughts from Pope Francis"":<br/><br/>On Migrants and Refugees<br/><br/>It is necessary to respond to the globalization of migration with the globalization of charity and cooperation, in such a way as to make the conditions of migrants more humane. At the same time, greater efforts are needed to guarantee the easing of conditions, often brought about by war or famine, which compel whole peoples to leave their native countries.Solidarity with migrants and refugees must be accompanied by the courage and creativity necessary to develop, on a world-wide level, a more just and equitable financial and economic order, as well as an increasing commitment to peace, the indispensable condition for all authentic progress.",0.9716
4,"Sorry, Alberto but in my experience, you are mistaken. I have been working in the building trades for over 49 years and while I respect the abilities and work ethic of many immigrant and migrant workers from the Latin American countries, they don't work harder than most ""American citizens who are used to have it easy here"". Many slack off when ever the oppurtunity arises. Americans work as hard, if not harder than most people in the world. The idea that foriegn born workers do the work that Americans won't do is also untrue. There is one job that I have never seen a Latin American immigrant doing and that is driving the ""honey wagon"" that is used to clean the ""porta potties"" that are used on most construction sites for human relief. I have talked to many men and women who do that job and most are native born Americans and the job pays surprisingly well given it's nature. Nice try Alberto, but no cigaro!",0.9676

6,"Actually, Steve, the Middle East gets way more media coverage in the United States than Latin America, even though Latin America is far more important to the United States.  <br/><br/>Latin America is a much bigger trade partner, much bigger source of immigrants to the United States, greater destination for foreign direct investment -- and now, on the issue of gay marriage, it is paving the way for the United States to follow.  <br/><br/>As the U.S. Supreme Court is about to hand down a decision related to this issue, it is useful for the NYT to report on shifting global norms, lest the American public fail to see that it is trailing on this particular issue of equal rights.

7,"Wars are happening all over the world: in the Middle East, in Korea, and one might even go so far as to say we are all fighting a war inside ourselves. While all this may be true, war has not been fought for the control of land for quite sometime. Now countries simply seem to fight on another countries behalf for their freedom against their own people. This is not true in Africa, however. Africa is China’s second largest source of oil and African rail roads, highways and airports are being redone by the Chinese government. Since China has such a huge impact on Africa, trade with the U.S. is going down, and the president doesn’t like that.<br/>	When President Obama visited Africa he “…laid out the case that Africa should be wary of China’s appetite for oil for its own use and instead embrace an American relationship that seeks to foster economic growth, democracy, health care, education and electrification,” surely leaving something for African leaders to talk about. I must agree that the U.S. government does have ways to help the African countries better than China may, but China is already there and they’re already helping Africa’s economy.

9,"Instead of a hopelessly corrupt bidding process in which small nations have nothing to offer but their vote and their integrity, FIFA should instead select World Cup countries on the strategic basis of where football and human development can best be expanded. Take some of the billions that flow through Geneva today and redirect them toward countries that need it for both football development and economic development.

10,"There are some who might question the motives of USA in doing this. But believe me, the majority of the average joes ( other than the local elites) across the world, do support US actions. The reality is everyone knows most of the countries and its systems and officials are highly corrupt and they see this a small victory against their corrupt  systems.

11,"The premise that we're dealing with American technology (and the ideological premises it supposedly encodes) is simply false. Much of this technology was created either outside the United States (e.g., the UK, Scandinavia, Australia, Israel) or by foreign engineers working in the US (e.g., Andrew Grove, Andreessen himself, Sergei Brin, etc.). It is the very definition of a global technology. Silicon Valley is a global hub, not an American one. There's a good reason why social media are so vital in the Middle East, Africa and Asia: far from radically transforming those cultures, they fit neatly within them. Egypt, Turkey and South Korea have not become libertarian through Twitter. ISIS is not a manifestation of YouTube's cultural hegemony. Thailand did not need Silicon Valley to commodify its young women; they've been doing it for centuries.",0.9153
12,I think this is fantastic! I'll tell you why. China's biggest advantage over the other industrialized nations is it's cheap labor. When you take that out of the equation what are you left with? You are left with a country that has lost it's edge! If the majority of the work they perform is via robots then other industrialized nations can compete on a more even threshold. <br/><br/>What we cannot lose sight of is China is trying possess the resources of this planet while they have the upper hand (money). If we allow this to happen they will secure their future while we sacrifice our own. ,0.9125

This seems a bit redundant, given that the purpose of a passport is to travel to other countries, but it stops short of saying, for example, New York, New York.<br/><br/>Jerusalem is a political issue but Berlin, for example, was also split between two countries at one time.  I assume (I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong) that US passports for people born in West Berlin said ""West Germany"", not ""West Berlin"".

First of all, should there be a distinction between asylum seekers and economic migrants? If not, and following Mr. Cohen's arguments, then the door should simply be thrown open, since asylum seekers obviously need a right of asylum to escape persecution and physical harm. As many articles have stated a very large number of the migrants are economic migrants. If life is tough in your country of origin, their motive is entirely understandable. However, that does not mean that destination countries are obliged to accept economic migrants in the way they should be obliged to accept e.g. political refugees. Europe's policy seems helpless, but if one accepts the distinction between refugees and economic migrants then it makes utter sense to try to stop the latter from entering in the first place. Nothing else applies to the US, which has a legal framework for accepting immigrants, but which does not just let someone in, simply because he or she wants to. Lastly, sometimes there seems to be an incredible ignorance by the elites about the concerns and worries of 'the great unwashed' about an open door policy for economic migrants. They are either extremists, hate mongers,  or, at best, haven't seen the light.
