0,"A Barbi doll is what Caitlyn looks like..our ideal of female beauty as a culture. In this, it seems she feels satisfaction. What needs to happen is that we accept our differences. Many intersex people exist..some even are real hermaphrodites. They are a natural but rare phenomena. They possess both sex genitals and can perform as either sex. People are born with a variety or continuam of sexuality, with different brain make ups etc. is what I've read. Bruce Jenner's journey made me very curious about why someone like her felt such an urgency after a life time of being a man. I think I understand better now. I don't know what Caitly's entire story is, and it is none of my business. I hope for her and her family, understanding, peace, compassion and happiness.",0.9892
1,"Choosing the Right Running Shoes by Gretchen Reynolds	August 5th, 2015<br/><a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/choosing-the-right-running-shoes/"" title=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/choosing-the-right-running-shoes/"" target=""_blank"">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/choosing-the-right-running-shoes/</a><br/>It is unique to find a study that’s results end up showing that “whatever feels best” is actually best for the body. However, it is a clear indicator that the body has a fair sense of what is right for the body. This is so psychologically important because often times people buy shoes for prestige, for certain features, or for their colorful designs. What they do not know is that when comfort is there for the actual function of the shoe, it is reducing the runner’s risk of injury. This is important because running is an important part of many athletics and activities. From being important to those who play sports to those who work out at a gym, the message is clear: although some shoes may seem more aesthetically appealing or favorable because of some novelty or their popularity, what is most important for the health of people’s feet is their comfort when they are wearing the shoes. Since this information is relevant to such a wide audience, it is important that there is more awareness among both shoe manufacturers and runners that their primary concern when making and buying shoes should be comfort so that better podiatary health is possible.

2,"I caught part of the last episode, where Caitlyn is gently confronted, first by Kim and then Khloe, about a perceived attack on their mother.  Kim states that the sisters support Caitlyn in her transition but are not comfortable with attacks on their mother.  Later, with Khloe, Caitlyn knows where the conversation is headed and strongly admonishes ""Don't go there!""  It didn't seem fair, given Caitlyn's journey.  The show is really worth watching, to see Caitlyn settling into a female persona, now that the surgical stuff is done.  What she knows about life, including family, was learned as Bruce, so Caitlyn's task is finding a new voice (which doesn't replicate Bruce's) and handling the (different?) personalities behind these voices.  I appreciated the transition as so much more than a female impersonation supporting a surgical approximation of a woman.  Caitlyn appears to be performing a feminine self.  The old Bruce (with his robust""California-masculine"" style), must now reside comfortably within this distinctly ""California-woman"" persona (still under construction).   I have even more respect for Caitlyn and also more sympathy for the family who have supported her.",0.9808

Usually babies wear rompers. Not only is it comfy, but it's also a look that kids, teens, and adults can wear. And the best part is that your only wearing one piece of clothing; putting undergarments aside. The reason why most women wear rompers is because its summer and it looks cute!"" “It provides a huge ‘no flashing’ benefit,” said Alexandra Amarotico, a 26-year-old photographer who lives in Hell’s Kitchen and has worn a romper four out of the last eight days, by her count. “It’s an especially nice perk in summer because your romper can be even shorter than your dresses on a hot day.” "" Rompers are great too because they  let you show off your legs without feeling overexposed. ""Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss have both been seen loping around town in rompers from the store."" Some people are calling the style ""big baby"" I suppose. When you wear a romper you should keep your accessories simple. ""Still, the best pro-romper argument may be the simplest one, which is that it cuts morning-outfit deliberation time in half. Why make two choices, top and bottom, when you can make one?"" I chose this article because it was cool.",0.9788
6,"As a man who has never visited a prostitute,  I feel that it is the male customers who are absent from this debate.   Many of them are married, prosperous and have much to lose by ""coming forward.""   Society takes advantage of this situation to continue the idea that ""men are perps and women are their victims.""<br/><br/>No doubt this is true in many cases but not in all.  When Eliot Spitzer patronized a prostitute, he lost his job, but she on the other hand became rich.  Apparently she was a singer as well and enough people downloaded her songs to make her rich.  So who was the victim?<br/><br/>Having been a teenager myself, I am well aware that lack of sexual outlet for men between 15 and 30 is a torment.   Perhaps one could say, ""Why don't they find a girl friend?""  But some men are ugly  (no, I am not one of them).<br/>Or they do not know how to approach a woman.   And we are condemning them to a lot of pain because we use underage prostitutes as the thin edge of the wedge to criminalize ALL prostitution.   An eighteen year old boy who patronizes a prostitute of 30 is, in our society, committing a crime.<br/><br/>The play Tea and Sympathy details the case of a married woman Laura who comes to the rescue of a boy Tom Lee so that he can prove that he is capable of sex.   But not every Tom has such a guardian angel.   Why do we torment boys like him?",0.9774
7,"Ok, yes, I thought the white silk corset was a questionable choice, hypersexualizing the presentation of Caitlyn Jenner's new persona. However, I do think that the transgender community has taught us how to celebrate ourselves. I was raised in a culture that said don't tease, don't flirt, don't dress in a way that draws attention. The transgender community taught me how to find my individual voice, that I could strut myself and dress fabulous for ME. When we lose control of our image, when it is subjugated to the expectations and uses of others, then things get weird. However, we can flirt, we can tease, we can explore our own sexuality through dress and presentation. The reason that can be ok, healthy, and even authentic is that our body image and our actual body aren't on the same page. I know there is a real disconnect between what I see in the mirror and what I know in my head. I want to connect with that fabulous person within and celebrate her without. Your participation is only in the affirmation. Say, ""You go, girl!"" In the end, that's all adornment that she needs. ",0.9726
8,"Over the past few years I've improved my appearance, mostly through a better wardrobe, losing a few pounds and learning how to better take care of my naturally curly hair. The result has been an increase in compliments and attention from both men and women, which caused a boost in confidence, which is an attractive quality, which caused more compliments, and so on. I don't think better hair will ultimately determine my dating destiny, any more than it would Greta's, but it could be a way to boost her self-confidence and happiness, which in the end makes far more difference in the dating world than the hair or clothing itself. Bringing up Greta's appearance might not be politically correct but it was a valid, practical suggestion in the world we live in.",0.9718

12,As usual an article about sexuality followed by a host of ignorant judgmental comments and stupid jokes.  I just find it terribly depressing that even in the NYTimes in 2015 it's impossible to have a rational and intelligent discussion of matters related to sex.<br/>It seems to me that the FDA was between a rock and a hard place on this one.  Depending on who you ask they were anti-women if they didn't approve it and they're anti-women by approving it.  It seems the drug is pretty marginal and will only be appropriate for a very few women.  But good for those few women.  If this drug can really help them to have the desire they need to maintain the relationship they want that's a wonderful thing.  Human desire is a complex and very individual thing.  Some of the people commenting here really need to work on their empathy.,0.964
13,"Speaking as an anthropologist, I don't agree with you that exploring masculinity is ""reactionary."" Yes, the humanities have typically ""taken the male as both subject and audience"" -- that's certainly true. But once you ask ""what kind of male?"" then you're on to something that's useful. <br/><br/>The world has many societies and cultures and masculinity certainly isn't conceptualized the same in all of them. There are many ways to be male, and it's always bothered me greatly that in the US and the west generally, those ways are assumed to be simple, largely biological, and as represetned in western literature and indeed western science. <br/><br/>One doesn't have to enter the toxic ""men's rights"" territory to explore all this. One only has to be interested in the enormous variety of maleness across our world. <br/><br/>So I think this is all very good, particularly good to the extent that it starts cutting away biology from culture (something anthropologists have been working at for a century or more).

14,"Thank you, geno, for pointing this out.

In this instance, in contrast to those countries, in both the private and public sectors, a freedom of religion and non-discrimination right for a Jew to wear a yarmulke, a Sikh to wear a turban, a Moslem to wear a head scarf, and other similar examples, illustrated by the recent Supreme Court decision involving a Moslem woman, a head scarf, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.  <br/><br/>Several interesting cases show the need to balance religion against other valid objectives, which means a middle ground if other countries choose to follow it.  One such case was in Florida, which requires a head shot photograph for a driver’s license.

However, for men the default is still a suit and tie.  Even if men decide to go for business casual in the summer and forgo the suit, the best they can do is to wear a short sleeve polo-- however, they must still wear pants, shoes, and socks with their polo.  <br/><br/>There is a big difference between the insulation value of the sundress and sandals outfit and the polo with chinos, socks, and shoes outfit.

Quite frankly seeing a transgender is not just foreign, but strange to me. I don't know how to react to being in the company of a transgender (and yes, I have been).

It surprised me how many people are against gender integration.  Especially the women at that.  Over the years, there have been women fighting for the right to do the same things that men are ""allowed"" to do.It amazes me that the  women that commented on this still think that women are not strong enough.  I admire the men and women that have their opinion in the middle.  They say women are able but if they know they can't do it, just don't go.  But then again that is what training is for. They will be able to strengthen themselves to the standard that they want to reach.  There is no excuse.  The subject upsets me though especially because I am a female.  I shouldn't be judged over the fact that some women cant do it, it isn't me so they don't know what i am capable of.  I can understand a woman saying she cant do something, but men say it all the time and don't get judged for it.  Its always ""oh its okay just try again"" but with women they are like oh that's normal.  It offends me just as i know it offends other females.

When they coerce young girls into sexual slavery through the threat of violence and use a firearm in the process, they are not indulging in choice but rather forced prostitution.  This is very different than a teen girl's right to choose whether to have an abortion or not.  Unfortunate that men can't discern the difference if it involves men in the equation.",-0.7565

When infants born with ambiguous genitalia or cloacal extrophy are arbitrarily assigned as females, about half of them reject that gender and insist they are boys.

Now how could this be, inasmuch as he was raised and ""conditioned"" as a girl?",-0.7724
222,"Do we want everyone looking alike every place we go?  As long as she was tastefully dressed, clean, polite, and knowledgeable about what she was selling what difference did wearing the head scarf make? She could have been wearing it because of chemotherapy.  She could have been wearing it because of her religion (which she was), or she could have worn it for fashion.  I think that too many companies get stuck on how people look rather than how well they can do the job.  I've dealt with plenty of people not wearing head scarfs who were fashionably dressed but had no business dealing with the public.  <br/><br/>After walking into too many stores where the merchandise looks like it's been hit by a tornado, the help is rude, the prices way too high, the store is dirty, loud, and there are overwhelming perfume scents in the air, I fail to see how an employee's wearing a head scarf, a yarmulke, a cross, or anything else can have a bad effect.  If management wants people to buy they ought to be on the lookout for bright, personable people who are clean, knowledgeable, and polite.  ",-0.782

He didn't seem to have any problem with his physical body or self-conception when it was winning him millions of dollars in endorsements. (Oh how little times have changed).<br/><br/>If he could just snap his fingers and transform, he would likely have been crippled by the ""dysphoria"" which strikes enormous numbers of girl children in the form of eating disorders (dieting) starting in pre-puberty.  Or perhaps he might have experienced the dysphoria that comes with  surviving rape and having no institutional, social, or interpersonal support to deal with the aftermath.  Perhaps he might have dysphoria when he is being discriminated against in the job market, only to look back and realize that stereotype threat and implicit bias ingrained in western society has kept him out of the most lucrative fields (i'm so dysphoric right now - I'm SUPPOSED to have been an engineer), and now the best he can hope for is being a second-fiddle player in the fields that deign to accept his professional efforts (always judging them as inferior, though).  <br/><br/>Don't get me started on menstruation and childbirth.<br/><br/>His minstrelsy of womanhood is a joke, a fairly insulting one at that.

If the costumed person sets a price ahead of time, then they’re a business that can be regulated.  Also, that gives the tourists an option of refusing the price ahead of time.<br/> If the person poses for pictures and then asks for a tip afterward, then the “tip” is optional and can be refused.  The ones who insist on a “tip” and then get abusive if they don’t feel that they’ve gotten enough, can be arrested for harassing the pedestrians – especially if they’re harassing children.  The people in costume could still be there so their rights wouldn’t be curtailed but they shouldn’t be allowed to infringe on the rights of the other people in the area through abusive behavior.

What had been a clean, classic line with a preppy backbone and an elegant, tailored urban edge now looks like frowsy leftovers you might pick up, and pass on at a thrift shop. It was once unimaginable to set foot in J Crew and not be tempted by several items, much less leave empty handed. Now, not even the models in stilettos can salvage their look!<br/><br/>Did it start with the tissue tees? Cozy, yes, but much less cotton required for production. $130 for a cardigan that's already pilling on the hanger, the seams of which will split down the sides upon second wearing. Expensive skirts that are too short or flashy to wear to work and too much trouble for everyday casual wear. Baggy trendy tees that you can't bend forward in without hawking your wares!

Empire/princess waisted floral mini dress (with the aforementioned cardigan) for that ""professional"" office look - with stilettos!<br/><br/>They must have built formulas that assumed high turnover for the style-of -the-week Zara model for ill-fitting poor quality clothes, but they alienated core customers, who prefer quality tailored clothes and predictable fit, and compounded the disaster by spiking prices well above the range for disposable clothing that flatters no one.<br/><br/>Also, middle-aged women former customers who built your brand remember, and don't shop J Crew for their kids.",-0.8587

It justifiably applies to the stunningly courageous men who landed on D-Day and the thousands of others who fight in wars or risk their lives for a principle.

The range of combinations may follow a normal curve and give us populations around the world that are, just let's say, 65% of men and women who hormonally fit their apparent biology. Then, 2-5%  who are opposite their appearance -- and are practicing homosexuals and lesbians.  That may leave around 25% of populations who are what we call ""latent"" homosexuals.  It is this very large group of biological latents that may be destabilized by gay and lesbian showing off, propaganda, publicity, celebration,etc.  Sexuality is one of the most, if not the most, powerful of human forces.  Exactly how ""latents"" may be destabilized by homosexual propaganda and celebrations and publicity can include thoughts, anxiety, doubts and a whole host of psychological and sociological problems, conflicts, stress, uncertainty, etc.  This is why homosexuals have been marginalized in almost every culture throughout time and why Russia passed a law against homosexual propaganda, not against gays and lesbians, against showing off. I believe the totally opposite tack being taken in the USA will contribute to the destabilization of American society.  The alternative is tolerance, not publicity that aims to endear and integrate: These groups have to live with their marginalization and adjust, not insist that whole societies adjust.  ",-0.9377

What??<br/><br/>Oppression is real, systemic injustice.  Feeling oppressed does not necessarily make it so--a person can suffer discrimination and interpret that as oppression or chalk it up to the narrow-mindedness of others. It is possible to reframe how we think about things, instead of trapping ourselves in a box for fear of losing the status of victimhood.<br/><br/>A person who has lived as one gender in a body that looks like it should be the wrong one lives a life of quiet desperation or chooses to align the two instead.  Ms. Jenner has chosen to align her inner and visible selves. Her choice of style makes her feel comfortable. Why criticize her ideal of loveliness?
