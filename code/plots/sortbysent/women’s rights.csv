0,"""Supreme Court Ruling Makes Same-Sex Marriage a Right Nationwide""<br/>June 26, 2015<br/>By: Adam Liptak<br/><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html"" title=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/us/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage.html</a><br/><br/>I found this article interesting because it is the first time in the United States to allow same- sex marriages. In this article, it stated that the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to allow same- sex marriages. Only about fifteen years ago, no one would have thought that same- sex marriage would be possible to do. Now in 2015, any race or gender can marriage whoever they want. This is a turning point in the society. People, who couldn't marry the same gender, now have the freedom to marry. In my opinion, I believe that the Supreme Court made the right decision by allowing same- sex marriages in the United States. The United States of America is known for the land of freedom so by legalizing same- sex marriages; it's living up to it's name. If the Supreme Court denied rights for same- sex marriages, then practically they are denying rights for people in the gay rights movement. This decision made by the Supreme Court will change the future of the whole world. Now, other countries might legalize same- sex marriages by following what the United States did. Same- sex marriages should be legal to do anywhere on Earth. By the decision the Supreme Court made, they gave hope for people who couldn't marry because they were different from others. Same- sex marriages is now free for anyone in the United States.         ",0.9939
1,"This is a great day not just for gay people but for all free women and men who want their marriages to be based on love rather than the biological imperative of reproduction. The Supreme Court has just sided with Shakespeare who said ""let us not to marriage of true minds/admit impediment"".  It does not matter what bodies these minds are housed in; it does not matter whether these bodies are capable of, or interested in, producing offspring. All animals reproduce; marriage is a human institution. And in a free society, this institution celebrarates our unique human capacity to find fulfillment in another human being.",0.9882
2,"""A Profound Ruling Delivers Justice on Gay Marriage""<br/>	A very interesting article this week was “A Profound Ruling Delivers Justice on Gay Marriage” written by the Editorial Board. This article is very pro-same-sex marriage and allows the readers to see how quickly the Supreme Court decision on legalizing same-sex marriage in all states has affected many. It persuades the reader to think that this decision represents the majority of Americans. This is backed up as fact since the author added convincing statistics saying how “marriage is legal in 36 states and the District of Columbia” and that it “represents more than 70 percent of all Americans.” Also, it compares it to other Supreme Court cases that have made big impacts on American history such as Dred Scott v. Sandford which puts into perspective the importance of this decision. The author used these facts to strengthen their opinion presented in the article. Though some groups may feel left out when the article refers to only “gays and lesbians” because there are many people of  other sexualities (bisexual, pansexual, etc.) that this affects. The decision seems to have erased other sexualities other than gays and lesbians, according to this article, which is the weak point in this article. other than that, the article has a clear argument that agrees with the Supreme Court’s decision.",0.9778
3,"I am a devout, practicing Christian.<br/>It makes me so terribly sad that people who claim to be Christians don't understand three things that are fundamental to the issue.<br/>1) Jesus Christ said ""Love thy neighbor as thyself"". In other words, God made everyone, God loves everyone, and so should you.<br/>2) In nature, about 10% of everything, plants, animals, fish, whatever, are ""homosexual"". Which is about the same ratio as gay humans, according to many studies.<br/>3) Gay marriages are more stable than straight marriages, and the children raised in same sex households tend to thrive. Those of us who are straight could learn a lot from the examples commitment and stability gay marriage provides.<br/>So what is the  point in getting all upset about some manufactured moral position that has no basis in spirituality, religious faith or nature? <br/><br/>Very personally, one of my dearest friends, a woman who was happily married to a man for many years, widowed, and has several children (both her own and adopted) and was alone for many years, just told me she is now engaged to her (female) life partner. I am thrilled for her, for them both. They love each other very much, and they just want to be married. <br/><br/>Nobody has the right to steal or interfere with anyone's happiness. It's guaranteed in the US Constitution and is the most basic of human rights.<br/><br/>My fellow Christians who have trouble with gay people: Get over it. Read your bibles. Remember what Christ said. Be supportive or shut up.",0.977
4,"The engagement party, bachelor party, bachelorette party,bridal party,rehearsal dinner,actual wedding reception,and post wedding brunch! Whew! Where does the money come from to pay for all these parties? I am a baby boomer who was married in 1984(and divorced in 2010) All we had was a wedding reception and a honey moon which we could barely afford. It appears everyone planning their wedding today must have annual incomes close to seven figures. Even so, instead of spending all their money on the wedding, dosen't it make more sense to use that money to buy a marital residence? And be sure to have a pre-nuptial agreement and save money for the divorce lawyers in case your marriage does not last ""till death do you part""! The last time I checked,50% of marriages still end in divorce!",0.9722
5,"Actually, the great thing is that we don't have to (reproduce, that is).  Straight people (and, to be accurate, also some gay people) are doing a bang-up job of producing gay people already, and there's no sign that that will stop.  Maybe they'll even do a better job of raising us now.  I love Darwinism, too, and have a great deal of respect for (and delight in) its sometimes counterintuitive results.",0.9674
6,"This letter is a big shout-out for Planned Parenthood!!  Although I am way beyond childbearing, Planned Parenthood has provided support and services on so many occasions in so many places, even while I was still a student.  I am the mother of a wonderful and wise young man, indirectly because of the support that I received from Planned Parenthood at the right times--they are accessible and budget-friendly (more than you can say about health care in the US, past and present).  The personnel are empowering--I have learned much about myself through them.<br/>I invite the bashers to take a stroll down memory lane to understand what reproductive services were like in the US before Roe v Wade, when only women with a large wallet or a cooperative physician would help them get the reproductive services that they needed.<br/>Sometimes I don't know if we are moving forward or backward.",0.9674
7,"If only you could be other than a white male for a day, Chris! Your blithe assertion that ""equal rights fully exist now"" is belied every day, every hour, every minute, by the experiences of those who are not heterosexual white males.<br/>Equal right do not exist for women, for African Americans, for Hispanics (whatever their birth status), for the handicapped, for the poor, and certainly not for the GLBT community.<br/>Marriage as a civil, legal, state-approved relationship has nothing to do with your god or your judgment; it is a contractual right between people who choose whom to wed and for their own purpose and reason--whether to be parents, or to enjoy the security of established companionship, or the bliss of romance, or simply the one-thousand-and-one legal and financial benefits bestowed on those who are married and that are unavailable to those who are not.<br/>Like so many, you know not of what you speak.",0.9606
8,"I have been arguing for years that prostitution (now called sex trade) should be decriminalized both will respect to the seller and with respect to the buyer.  The only interest that the state has in these transactions is with respect to health and disease related to both parties.  For instance, condoms should be required.  Regular health testing should be required.  Active consent should be required.  For those who have no other sexual outlet and want sex as a physical release the purchase of sexual favours is important to mental and physical health.  Spare me the morals.  The sex trade has been around for eons.  ",0.9538
9,"Do you really believe that President Kennedy would have approved of abortion on demand and gay marriage? Perhaps I am wrong but I don't recall  him advocating for those two issues. Everyone's character is made up values and convictions which have to come from somewhere. Should we search for presidential candidates whose values were formed from just the study of philosophy or , perhaps, reading the NYTimes religiously? Many people have a strong faith after years of study and it becomes the guiding light in their lives and cannot be separated from their whole being.",0.9452
10,"A few decades ago a couple who were marriage counselers wrote a best sellling book called ""Open Marriage"" championing adultery which they claimed would save a marriage.<br/><br/>Ten years later they wrote another best selling book titled ""The New Fidelity"" reversing their opinion on how to save a marriage.<br/><br/>They ruined thousands of marriages with their first erroneous conclusion that adultery was beneficial to a marriage.<br/><br/>A marriage not based on mutual respect and without a spiritual goal of raising children to be decent human beings will never succeed in the long run.",0.9439
11,"Same sex marriage was a huge step forward for LGBT rights, but we still need formal recognition of sexual orientation and gender identity as classes protected against discrimination in the Civil Rights Act. Just like religion.<br/><br/>And time spent on this issue hasn't taken away from the other issues. It's not our fault we can't get the political establishment to care enough to find a solution rather than filibustering the other side any time they say anything. We need to get the baby boomers out of office, because they've ruined this nation's political discourse.",0.9292
12,"I saw a lot of myself in this article.  Like you, I would have lost it sooner if the opportunity had presented itself, but I also suspect that it's a lot better if not engaged into casually.  Maybe that's part of a mildly prudish upbringing, social ineptness, or maybe that's just how I'm wired, I dunno.  (If somebody wants to have sex early, often, and in great variety with a variety of partners, that's fine with me, it's just not me.)<br/><br/>For the record, 23, with the woman 12-yrs my senior who became my wife a couple years later.  We've been happily married 13 years now.",0.9207
13,"Because marriage is oh, so much more than the negatives you quoted. No matter what anyone says (and I'm not a blushing 20 year old bride [athough who knows if they even existed after the 1800s]), partnership, company, friendship and love trump all. Just be happy for anyone who elects marriage. I'm very glad I did.",0.9184
14,"Well, here we go with the libs painting the planned parenthood involvement in selling baby body parts as nothing more than a poor attempt by radical anti abortion proponents of untruths. So, I guess the video's are not true.<br/>Women who decide not to complete a pregnancy are getting poor advice from planned parenthood. How about adoption?<br/>And, to say the republicans don't care about the lives of the poor and disenfranchised is a flat out lie. The money that has been poured into these poor communities is nothing short of astonishing. To me it looks as if the libs have sold the poor impoverished communities a bill of goods; Baltimore,  , Chicago and many other communities have voted the libs in for 50 plus years. How's that working for everyone?<br/>The fact of the matter is that every life is precious. If u libs are so concerned with the rights of the poor and those less fortunate, where is your concern for the rights of the unborn?. I guess they have no rights...and don't tell me u r saving these unborn babies from a life of poverty etc...that's not your decision...you have no right to even say it..",0.9182
15,"My kid is on the spectrum. She would say everything was fine, perfectly fine - until it wasn't - and wasn't in a spectacularly explosive way. We're not talking average folks here who can discuss their feelings when they're ready, or keep them to themselves in a controlled manner. We're talking - explosive. The dog allows them to acknowledge that, well, yes, there IS something... and then how much they share becomes their choice. I highly doubt that they get waterboarded if they choose not to share! :) ",0.9103
16,You guys shouldn't be proud of this supreme court decision.  I still can't marry my daughter and after all two people who love each other should<br/> be able to get married.  Or do you believe only SOME people who love each other should get married?,0.8872
17,"I have not used Planned Parenthood's services. I have not had any abortions, but would have been able to, had I needed to.  I have had the usual range of reproductive health services from other providers. <br/><br/>I support PP because all women should have access to the same range of services that I have.  <br/><br/>I am particularly concerned about younger women who take for granted that all these rights and services will always be there for them.<br/><br/>We must speak up, as Ms. Pollitt says; but we also must put our money and our votes where our mouths are. <br/><br/> I intend to increase my annual donation to PP.<br/><br/> I  also intend to pay closer attention to my elected representatives responsible for their votes and speeches on this issue, and hold them accountable.  ",0.8847
18,"Am I reading what I think I am reading? Human life being created for the express purpose of being sold?  Even though this serves a consumer's most benevolent desire, and even though there is a meaningful gap between a frozen embryo unconnected to life support and a viable fetus securely on its way in a mother's womb, this still feels unsettling. The ardent desire to have a family doesn't support buying a newborn, and even though this is not at all like buying a newborn, it shows that the purity of desire to have a family and love a child is insufficient to justify commodification of human life. As a society, we  may have to draw a bright line, and soon, not on when human life begins, because surely all of us began at conception, but on when human life is deserving of the protections of citizenship (not being legally owned, destroyed, or harmed). For now, this life is suspended, and the conditions for its path to development are limited to those inside a willing human female body. I am not sure we may safely presume that will always be the case <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/print-thyself"" title=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/print-thyself"" target=""_blank"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/24/print-thyself</a>",0.8758
19,"Rohit, the reason abortion is the woman's decision is because it is HER body and HER life that is involved. SHE is pregnant. Not the father, not the government, not you. If she has the baby SHE will be responsible for taking care of it. The father might be there, or might not. He might provide care and support - or not.  God knows the Ohio legislature won't be helping raise the child, or providing health care or child care or a roof over its head. <br/><br/>The fetus is not a person. It can't live outside the mother. It in no way resembles an individual. Like it or not, until it can live outside the mother's womb it has no rights. <br/><br/>Your last 4 sentences are ridiculous and don't make any sense. Those who are pro-choice don't talk about religion; it""s the anti-choice crowd who do, as they try to impose their religious views on others.",0.8657
20,"... and if the mother has never experienced depression until she became pregnant?

23,"A lot of fallacious reasoning in this column.  I won't dignify the hyperbole about 'mass feticide' with a response, but to address his main point, how is abortion rate the best metric to evaluate the success of social policy?  Of course the abortion rate is lower in red states with heavy restrictions on abortion, because it's harder to get an abortion.  The only thing that proves is that if you are determined enough you can force a higher percentage of women into carrying unwanted pregnancies.   It does not mean that family planning programs are ineffective.",0.855
24,"The example set by the U.S. Supreme Court in affirming gays' right to marry could have a positive effect worldwide: people look to this country, are greatly influenced by what goes on here.<br/> One has only to know a few gays to hear stories about their having being threatened with violence, even loss of life in certain situations.  I remember a colleague at work saying that gays should all be lined up and shot. (I hoped he was kidding but to this day am not sure).<br/>It goes back to the golden rule - the rights and freedoms we'd want for ourselves should also be there for our gay friends.",0.8537
25,"You have to understand that the abortion issue is not about abortion at all and is not a fact-based issue.  It is about garnering political support on a highly emotionally charged stance, based on an identification with 'unborn babies', which is an inherently oxymoronic and self-contradictory term and is at odds with religious history, science, ethics, and law, because the alleged concern for the well being of fetuses is used as a proxy to exert physical political power over women and their bodies, the place where the fetuses exists and are dependent on.  Such fundamental facts are completely ignored and are never discussed, but rather, blame is put on the sexual behavior of women in getting pregnant, though this clearly requires another human being of the opposite gender, who is never held to account for the procreative activity.  Any child can recognize the difference between a fetus and a baby, because the latter has been born and is an individual being.  Beyond the epistemological aspects, there is also the practical aspect of collective human behavior and what actions or policies effectively result in fewer abortions, in which the pro-life movement also appears entirely disinterested, and actively opposes.",0.8536
26,"But then there were Heidegger's choices -- fire Jews, etc. to help implement Naziism in German academe.  He was responsible for a good bit of that and associated actions. See his private journals that are now coming out for evidence of what he did and why -- not that his choices hadn't been revealed already, but his journals at least can't be claimed to be prejudiced against him, or to misunderstand his exquisitely subtle thinking.  Seneca's a good recommendation, but I think you should reconsider your second choice. Your general point is a good one, and  there are plenty of pertinent books to chose from.",0.8338
27,"African-Americans only make up about 10% of the U.S. population, even in the 1950s and 1960s. Did they not deserve coverage of their civil rights advances?<br/><br/>The advance of gay rights is more impactful than you may realize, as gays are found across all stripes of race, economic status, and religion. Even if it's only 5%, that's likely one in every 20 people you know, whether or not you even realize it.<br/><br/>So, yes, gay issues are of interest to anyone who has more than a handful of family members, friends, and co-workers.",0.8316
28,"I think you have profoundly missed not only the legal point of this argument, but its more subtle emotional nuances. Some people just don't marry... They don't...Not even if marriage boosters like you sing the Marriage Is Wonderful song all day long.  Whether by choice or by simply not having your great good luck at meeting that lovely spouse (because I am assuming you are married), they are single. But they have lives that should not have to be defended like I feel compelled to do here in the face of your insensitivity. These ARE different relationships; the point of the essay was to argue that one should not be legally valued over the other. Different does not mean better. ",0.8221
29,"This isn't just about people getting married.  It is about the institution of marriage itself.  This decision protects that institution from being held hostage by those seeking to impose their particular form of religion on others.  It prevents marriage from becoming the exclusive property of a few bigots, available only to those deemed worthy by those zealots.<br/><br/>The institution of marriage has been protected and therefore strenghtened today.

The fact is, if she had to go to the emergency room or deal with some legal issue, people treated me like her husband and never even questioned our relationship.  Not once has anyone asked us for a marriage license.  Now we're married for the health insurance coverage.  Again, fine with us.  But gay folks don't get the same treatment.  If they have to get married to be legally recognized as partners and be able to make decisions for each other and care for each other, so be it.  Maybe that won't be necessary some day in the future, but right now they need the proof that their relationship is legitimate.",0.7682
31,"I will be really interested in how the Supreme Court comes out on same-sex marriage.  Assuming they find a constitutional right to same sex marriage, the reasoning will be very important.  If it's a equal protection argument, the court is implicitly supporting polygamy.  (If the states can't limit marriage to one man/ one woman, what limits are they allowed to enforce?)  On the other had, if it's a sexual discrimination argument as some have proposed (Susie can marry Jack, but not Jill) that allows for same sex marriage without opening the door to polygamy. <br/><br/>But of course, the courts shouldn't even be involved.  We should have a national referendum like Ireland did. ",0.761

34,"Perhaps Planned Parenthood should spin off the abortion side of its operation and give it another name with separate accounting. I doubt it would satisfy the ""Life"" coalition but it would remove their money argument.<br/>   Planned Parenthood is an excellent name for most of its operation.

That goes for the states too. <br/><br/>Not sure that will be so easy, but the concept, if they are truly reordering the social order, is to leave out the ""same-sex"" in marriage because that implies there is a true marriage and a fake new one that needs modification.  <br/><br/>Let's get on that mass-media editors, flacks, and propagandists and fix it, so ""marriage"" can mean just about whatever a person chooses it to mean.

137,"""Court Says 4 Catholic Nonprofits Must Allow Workers Access to Contraception"".<br/>The Catholic community is rather bold in their stance on birth control and abortion. People across the country are divided in being supportive or opposed to those views. These 4 Catholic nonprofits choose to not provide coverage for their employees to get birth control. Recently, however, a court ruling said that the religious groups can opt out of paying for the controversial medical services without banning the employees from the services. The religious groups are incredibly offended by the fact that they have to fill out a magnitude of paperwork to escape having to personally provide the services they are so against. This caught my attention because it seems to be a violation of the religious groups' rights. If it is against the beliefs of the employers, I think they should not be forced to go through with it. As employees, they know exactly the religious beliefs of the company they are working for and I'm sure, since it is a nonprofit, many of the employees share those opinions. Since that is a safe assumption, I think it is fair for them to be hesitant to offer birth control. Also, handing out contraception is directly contradicting their beliefs that premarital sex or carelessness is wrong and a sin. If they say one thing but do the opposite they are leaving space for their followers to be confused on their intention and it in turn threatens their reliability. ",-0.6815
