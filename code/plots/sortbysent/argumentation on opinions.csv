1,"""Equating celebrity with leadership and business with governance""<br/><br/>A rather broad statement that may be true or false or correct or incorrect or....what exactly. Perhaps the Times pickers  could explain, as the implied self-evident wisdom of the statement escapes me. Nor do I understand why I should accept that Trump supporters think whatever you say they think. <br/><br/>There is celebrity in leadership and business in governance. Do you agree?",0.9287
2,"I hope this will also make it more likely that health care providers won't assume that they know what a patient wants towards the end of their lives -- just framing it as a question with multiple possible answers would be a positive change, in my opinion, and would give an elderly person a better chance to express their choice and be less likely to feel railroaded.  My mother had me to help her make sure her wishes were heard, but it amazed me how many doctors didn't seem to want to listen.",0.9269

5,"I'm at a loss to reconcile your account here with what actually is occurring, and has occurred, in the U.S. context you refer to. ""Educated"", as an adjective, obliges the individual it denotes to provide fair descriptions of events from which valid claims and sound conclusions emerge. You failed to meet that standard. That institutions, be they the U.S. Congress, the Supreme Court, or labour unions, can be sources of corruption and wrong doing is not news. But they aren't inherently so, despite Paul Tillich's assertions to the contrary. When they are, it's because at their core, narrow interests have supplanted a broader disinterest, or, rather, a commitment to justice and fairness that emerges from upholding the public good. That's what's wrong currently. We are first and foremost members of the NRA, or ""educated middle class professionals"", and only secondly citizens with broader responsibilities to the culture than our own narrow self interests.

6,"Mr. Fishman answers questions in defense mode. Questions about the need for change are put off into a vague, expensive, and cumbersome future, and meanwhile the virtues of the status quo -- cheap food! jobs! free markets! -- are raised to put out any remaining fires.<br/><br/>He is an apologist, not a critic. It would be nice to have a critic to balance out Mr. Fishman's ""leave it alone for now"" stance.",0.8751
7,"This seems like a bad set of analysis. First Appiah says I'm puzzled, like it's difficult to understand how displaying ivory jewelry might inspire people to seek out ivory. The antique designation is irrelevant in that respect. It's not going to have a sign saying this was before or after the ban. Bloom thinks it's OK because it was before the ban and it doesn't matter what other people think. Focusing on the effective date of the ban implies that it was OK on one day, but not on the next one.Apply the same logic to issues like slavery, segregation, etc.; it doesn't hold up. Her other proposition that everything has a distasteful background it disingenuous. That's not established, but the sourcing process for ivory is clear. While I find Yoshino more acceptable, wearing it only in private seems just a little weird. I acknowledge the challenges of the question, but I think the best recommendation would be to wear it discreetly, and if you are aware of someone noticing it, start a dialogue. ",0.8616
8,"Sadly, I cheered his zing back at Megyn. She certainly had it coming. While the question subject was sort of legitimate, the way it was phrased was emphatically designed to indite and convict before a response could be offered. Bizarrely, it appears that his response that most of the words were from a catfight with Rosie O'donnell was accurate (I had thought he had just thrown it out there before fact checking.) Unlike other questions, the subject of treatment of women was not asked the others, who mostly seemed thrilled to commit a woman to death to avoid risking the health of a fetus and even happier to ensure that poor women would have no place to go for medical care by defunding Planned Parenthood. <br/><br/>Yes, maybe Trump (who will not get the chance to be a terrible president) could have been more politically correct toward someone asking a clearly biased question, and we want more deliberation and fineness from our Diplomat in Chief and  Commander in Chief, but Megyn richly deserved at least a good zinging.",0.8393

64,"A complaint about terminology: Wren-Lewis's reasoning isn't ""a priori."" It may be armchair speculation, which should be tested empirically before being given much credence, but that's not what makes reasoning a priori. If you calculate how fast a feather and a rock will drop in ordinary air, and do so based on Newton's laws, you will be using an empirically well-verified theory, not one based on a priori reasoning. But you will be engaging in armchair reasoning if you only speculate about which forces - such as air pressure - are present, and haven't yet checked to see whether your speculation-based calculations fit the actual rates of fall. Your calculations would thus be armchair reasoning.<br/><br/>A priori reasoning, in contrast with empirical reasoning, is reasoning derived solely from examining relations between ideas. Noticing that a model doesn't take into account the zero lower bound is a prior reasoning - it is about what ideas are contained in the model. Empirical reasoning examines how well ideas fit with the world, such as noticing that the zero lower bound fits actual behavior.<br/><br/>The fact that one is merely speculating about empirical facts, without testing these speculations, makes one's reasoning purely speculative (armchair). But it is empirical reasoning nonetheless - it is a guess based on experience. It is not a priori reasoning which, as the term was originally defined, is limited to issues that can be concluded solely based on conceptual entailments. ",0.0745

123,"in my case, and in the case of most imigrants, this white privilege argument is laughable, it's not only that I haven't inhereted anything from my parents, but I had to help them when I imigrated to US while they stayed in the old country which is poor, and so did millions and millions of other imigrants that came here dirt poor and were still very succesfull<br/><br/>let's try another theory ",-0.8294

125,"We're glad to see people recognize their errors, and in the long run I believe this needs to be a more frequent occurrence for more economists.<br/><br/>I've been pretty worked up, angry, over the TPA authority and more specifically the TPP.  The model I use tells me this really is a bit of a disaster for the world.  We should be doing better than this, but it is going to take a long time to get the models across to the right people.<br/><br/>I know for a fact that my Republican representative doesn't care whatsoever what I think about any of this, so there's no point in contacting him.  The administration doesn't care either, and that will be a lasting disappointment for me.<br/><br/>I'm actually quite confident that this will be sorted out and corrected over the years, but it is going to require a lot of work to get there.",-0.8714

127,"I'm a liberal, but unlike what seems to be most liberals, I don't conflate a good SCOTUS decision with one that agrees with my personal pov and vice versa.<br/><br/>It is important to point out that, for instance, whatever the clamor; the CU case DID NOT give corporations something new ie personhood. That misrepresentation of the facts of the case is allowed, by media, to be repeated ad nauseum by angry liberals, who only start paying attention when a case goes against their grain. Corporations HAD that status already - repeat: corporations HAD that status already! CU thenceforth removed what can be considered using ordinary logic, arbitrary constraints on that status.<br/><br/>As a liberal I do not like the totality of this freedom for corporations. What I like is not the point, and that is the lesson I suggest people grasp. The CU decision was a goo legal judgment, the answer for the angry is a Constitutional Amendment, a thing that take actual work, rather than selfish whining, to accomplish.",-0.9058
128,"But the point of the registry is to warn the public about sexual predators.  It seems absurd to make a lifetime determination that this 19 year old is and always will be a danger to the community because he exercised poor judgment in having sex with a girl who may or may not have looked old enough.  She was roughly in his age category so at this point it is logical to assume he will continue to seek out women his age (unlike a 30 year old charged in a similar situation).  At 19, he is not even considered old enough to drink alcohol.  Clearly, the law does not consider him to be as mature as a 30 year old.  At the very least, the law ought to provide for different categories of offenses and periodic review so that people who no longer pose a threat to society can have their names removed.",-0.9081
129,"Typical Trump. Used to being in charge and having things his own way. Upset because he wasn't able to choose the questions or the people that ask them. Has never had to and never will accept being wrong. He will always blame the other person. Finally has put himself in a position where people don't care about his money. He will never understand that either. Even now, he will blame the party. I suspect his next move will be to have his own debate. ",-0.9155
130,"Somewhere in the obscure logic of the US constitution is something related to gerrymandering. I can't recall it but I know it's there.<br/><br/>I disagree pretty with your logic. Let's consider it in classic Greek philosophical terms: you say it's okay because both sides do it. Is there not a fundamental right and wrong? Certainly, you would agree that if a thing causes no harm then it doesn't matter what is done or who does it? But, if someone is harmed, namely the general public, right and left, then the thing must be wrong. Q.E.D.",-0.9165
131,"@Sven Ortmann<br/>Much more complicated, yes.  But still broadly true, as you discount the power of the 'bully pulpit' to browbeat weak politicians into voting for the wrong things for the wrong reasons.  It hasn't been the Democrats baying for tax cuts as a party platform for the past 40 years, though too many were dragged into being complicit in voting for them anyway, against their (presumably) better judgement.  The Republicans are now in the sorry position of defending 40 years of diminishing returns not by taking responsibility for their mis-diagnosis of the role of taxation on the economy, but by pointing at the victims of the Republican steamroller, the Democrats, and saying 'well, they agreed with us'.  Lame.",-0.9171
132,"Hi Dagwood, sure let's go with your assertion that an embryo cannot be assigned a human label; an assertion many would disagree with based on the latest Gallup.  But based on your own premise (one i disagree with), aren't you also obliged to add ""but i could be wrong"" to your statement of belief?  So based on your premise, just as I should say  ""we could just be killing balls of tissue"", you are also required to say ""we could be killing unborn babies"".  And if that's the case, I would much rather be wrong about killing tissues than babies.  I, like you, also think that our society values ""individual freedom of choice and democratic ideals,"" but also a society that values the lives of our little ones above ALL.

134,"Trump blew himself up tonight.  He couldn't answer questions posed to him, and was therefore asked again to answer them, at which point he seemed to grow hostile and bothered and nervous.  He showed he knows nothing of economics and international trade, saying he didn't want to work with our important trading partners, but he wanted to beat them.  That would only result in restrictions imposed on our exports.  And this is the danger that comes with a vicious man who is inexperienced in the real world, and seems to live in his plastic-America reality show world where he can be friendless.",-0.9356

136,"There's a scary precedent in Awlaki whether or not you agree that his assassination was necessary. <br/><br/>Let's take your questions and assume that the conclusion is ""yes it was right to kill him."" I have seen a lot of people reach that affirmative conclusion and then uncritically extrapolate that because his death was justified, the process used to kill him must also be justified.<br/><br/>That's an easy extrapolation to fall into but it's very dangerous. It sets a precedent that the President, with minimal oversight, can order the death of any citizen he or she personally judges to be a threat based on secret information only the President and a tiny group of advisers are allowed to know. <br/><br/>Maybe (?) so far this extraordinary Presidential power has only been used justly, but that does not mean it will always be used justly in the future.<br/><br/>There is the morally loaded question of the end in this particular case, which you are right to ask. But I think it is critically important to explicitly state that this question of ends is separate and distinct from the wisdom of the means and processes used to arrive at that end.",-0.9538
137,"I disagree with those who think Ms. Dowd is missing the point by focussing on the man vs. the issues. whenever this country has faced crises (and it assuredly faces several crises today, from the tepid economy, to foreign policy ad infinitum), it has been blessed with leaders who rose to the occasion. Without strong leadership, polarization renders us impotent to solve problems. This president has been gifted with oratory skills, but little else. It's bad enough that he's not worked with Republicans (how else does one compromise?), but he's ignored those in his own party as well. He prefers simply to issue Executive Orders. It's been pointed out many times that it's far more difficult today than in LBJ's time to horse trade, but there has been absolutely no attempt to do the tough lifting our nation requires. It's constant campaigning only. What a tragedy.",-0.9577
