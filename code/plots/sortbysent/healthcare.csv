The uninsured don`t need medical coverage, unless one happens to be a family member. Romney shares disdain for the life of the 47% but will shut down his company to look for the daughter of a partner. Conservative principles are strictly for those outside the circle. Inside it is a socialist paradise, with unlimited access to education, medical care, material comforts, and connections to employment. Apparently living in a cradle to grave hammock is only a problem if you get the support from outside your social group.<br/><br/>Lee is an easy call.  Despite some impressive military victories, liking animals, a love of painting, and being notably faithful to his girl friend, nobody has to live on Hitler Blvd.",0.9859
1,"The Robert's court's ruling is truly amazing as it does suggest that we are finally on the road toward health care for all in America.  But as amazing is the resistance's refusal to acknowledge that the reform actually leaves much waste, duplication, opportunism, and private profit completely untouched.  This differentiates the ACA from Social Security and Medicare.  One can still get quite rich selling health care to Americans. What ethical system says people should profit from others' suffering?",0.9816
2,"@ Lori:<br/>Much history indeed. I mostly agree with your observations, with a few modifications:<br/><br/>""Traditionally (1950-60's) most psychiatrists had basic therapy training + 3-4 further years of psychoanalytic education. ""<br/><br/>Well, not always. Outside of a very few enclaves most psychiatrists did not go to the psychoanalytic institutes,through the PSAs were at the top of the caste system, and others often tried to emulate them. In the analytically-oriented programs, residents did usually get pretty good training in dynamic therapy. In other ""eclectic"" programs. anything could go. The joke was ""Eclectic means electric."" <br/><br/>"" Unfortunately they also felt ""superior"" to other mental health professionals, tho (1970's 80's) psychologists and clinical social workers sought their own good psychoanalytic education. ""<br/>and<br/>"" including the the period where (mostly male) psychiatrist-colleagues felt ""superior"" to me (then an intelligent, hopefully, thoughtful female clinical social worker).""<br/><br/>Oh yeah! And as I alluded above, may of them were not as well trained.<br/><br/>""But be sure if you want therapy that the therapist is extensively trained as well as compatible.""<br/><br/>Exactly. You sound very wise. Keep up the good fight.",0.9802
3,"As a practicing prosthodontist ( a dentist that specializes in esthetic, implant and restorative dentistry), I see many patients that have spent a lot of time and money fixing dental problems and I do the very best I can to help them maintain good oral health throughout their lifetime. No matter the order of oral hygiene methods, the most important thing is to be thorough. If you floss first, it is a good idea to rinse to remove loosened particles before brushing so you don't push them back into spaces between the teeth. Either way it is also recommended to use an antibacterial mouth rinse after thorough brushing and flossing to help decrease the amount of bacterial plaque that can build up. I also recommend frequent visits with my dental hygienist. It is easier for patients to maintain good oral hygiene if they are professionally cleaned every 3 or 4 months. Some patients that exhibit excellent oral hygiene practices can go up to 6 months between professional cleanings.",0.9769
4,"Touchet:  You are right that a single payer health care system would lower the income of many health care professionals. That is the whole point, because we have way too many of them, performing unnecessary procedures, at too high a cost. Every study of our health care system reaches this conclusion. We spend twice as much for health care as our European and Japanese peers. That extra money goes to good professionals, and some to unnecessary transaction costs in our health care insurance system.<br/><br/>Face it, health care has become a make work, wealth re-distribution system for some members of the middle class. What we ought to do, and what Bernie suggests is put our middle class to work rebuilding our infrastructure, educating our children, revamping transportation and energy production to eliminate CO2.

5,"My god man, what did you do that required such self flagellation as that?  <br/><br/>And you were debating Mr. Moore in front of any audience that booed and hissed before you made your argument, at just the mere mention that Obamacare was a success?  Will Moore return the favor by debating you in San Francisco's Castro District?  Or just to make thing a little fairer, on NYU's campus during the academic year and not during exam season?<br/><br/>When an audience is that biased against you, you have to use rhetorical tactics to get them to listen.  Try something like:  Well, my opponent Moore does have some merit to his argument.  Take Obamacare, which has had its problems, conceding the problems with the rollout.  Then present the numbers that show Obamacare's success. <br/><br/> And continue:  Though these numbers are far better than Obamacare's critics and even it supporters expected, you must remember that Obamacare is really a conservative Republican program, which Heritage Foundation's scholars created; provide the citations to the Heritage Foundation's publication of what is in all material respect Obamacare.  So given that Obamacare was the best that Republicans could do to reform our failing healthcare system, I am sure that we liberals can do much better; then give them the numbers on relative GDP spending on healthcare for advance democracies that use single-payer healthcare insurance, which is about 9% of GDP, as oppose to the numbers for Republican Obamacare, which is about 17.1% of GDP.",0.9715
6,"""A better way to address our health care challenges is to put patients and doctors in charge of health care decisions."" Tom Price, R GA, US House Budget Chair<br/><br/>The GOP insists they have a better plan and wrap it in the seductive language of choice. Americans should be able to choose the insurance they want rather than the government telling them, he said on NPR today. <br/><br/>Of course, we tried that. That's how we got a $2.7 trillion health care industry and over 15% uninsured and climbing. And the insurers were free to choose to deny or cancel coverage if you actually needed it, which is why individual plans were cheaper. And women paid more, especially if they were of child bearing age. <br/><br/>With no standards, comparing policies was impossible.<br/>Insurance was an optional choice so a lot of younger people went without, making the risk pool older and less healthy. Based on their rhetoric. any GOP plan would have no mandates on employers, insurers or citizens. All choice. Just like before 2010.<br/><br/>The best promise of the ACA in cost control will come from evidence based medicine facilitated by electronic records. All kinds of useless treatments, surgeries and drugs will no longer be regarded as sound practice. And that will make a huge difference, especially with Medicare.",0.9683
7,"Those who propose getting rid of the health insurers through some form of single-payer system are often naïve.  First, non-profit health insurers, due to the constraints of their non-profit status, reap very little margin from the financing of health care. Furthermore, the amount of money insurers pay for various health care procedures is generally guided by Medicare, so the insurers are often not deviating that drastically from what the government is also doing.  Unlike non-profit insurers, physicians groups are often dramatically over-compensated regardless of their quality. We have a system in which surgeons are making $500,000 a year, incentivized to provide more care in order to make more money, with the necessity of many procedures already questioned.  That, readers, is a profit motive.  If you want to reduce the profit motive in health care, you are going to have to shift away from a fee-for-service model and move into a salaried model like at the VA Hospitals or the NHS in the UK: in those systems, physicians and other health professionals are salaried and do not have an incentive to provide more care and bill more CPT codes.  Additionally, if you look at Canada's single-payer system, it's a disaster, particularly with regards to certain areas of care, like mental health, medical rehabilitation, and others.  I'm a 3rd generation Democrat, but I'm not naïve when it comes to health care.  Do your homework, then re-consider how good a single payer system would be.      ",0.9654
8,"Reality is catching up to the Flim-Flam-Obamaman.<br/>This POTUS promised $2500 reduction in healthcare costs per family.<br/>He claimed that 30 - 40 million Americans wanted health insurance and couldn't afford it.<br/>Under obamacare, even with govt subsidies, at best 1/3 of the previous uninsured signed up - but that is an obamastat - others say about 1/4.<br/>Who signs up? Sick folks. Who doesn't sign up? The majority of those uninsured, i.e. young, healthy, optimistic adults.<br/>Obama conned the insurers into believing that all previously uninsured would immediately sign up. He even promised the insurers that the Feds would cover their loses. Not happening.<br/>Hense the insurers, a pretty heavily regulated industry at the state level, need to charge more. Surprise!!!!!<br/>Thanks to all you flatearthers who empowered Flim-Flam-Obamaman.<br/>Oh! And conservatives did have a better plan - you just weren't listening :(",0.9612
9,"The insurance companies have no systematic motivation to reduce drug prices.  Under the law, 78% of the premiums paid have to go to health care (including the drugs) and the remaining 22% is available for overhead and profit.  If they reduce overhead they get to  keep the difference, but the same is not true of the cost of care.<br/><br/>Assume that they set the premium at $100, assuming that care would cost $78, leaving $22 for overhead and profit.  It turns out the care only cost $60, they have to give you back $23.08 Because they should have charged you $76.98, $60 for care and $16.98 for profit.<br/><br/> You are correct that the analysis is worthless and that it will be interesting to see if there are improvements in health outcomes.",0.9604
10,"This is good news for the ACA and the 17 million people that now have health care.  <br/><br/>But I can't help but think that this is a victory for the Health Care industry and, in particular, the Health insurance industry.   Someone will be paying for this healthcare and it will be everyone in the middle.   In a single year Health care coverage is already more expensive and requires higher upfront costs.    <br/><br/>I think eventually the American people will drive the towards a single payer model because the current ACA is at best a workable, but expensive hybrid system.",0.9573
11,"So many ethical issues here.  Dr. Kaplan, where are you?  I'm sure he has thoughts on the matter.<br/><br/>Several years ago, I wrote a training course on kidney transplant for sales reps of a drug company developing a new immunosuppressant.  The ins and outs of Medicare coverage are truly complex, and often inconsistent--like so many Medicare rulings.<br/><br/>Based on what I know about donations, I think the goal should be to compensate donors for costs associated with donation--which Medicare already covers--but not the actual organ.   Once you put a price on an organ you go down that slippery slope of encouraging people who might be in a financial bind to do something they might regret.<br/><br/>For donors, an alternative would be to cover costs for any subsequent health issue arising from the actual donation.  That's only fair, they made a sacrifice, and should be able to donate without fear of financial ruin.<br/><br/>As long as it's not creating a ""market"" for kidneys, which could arise were a price tag set by the government--and only reimbursing health costs and travel expenses related to the donation--I think that passes the ethical smell test.",0.9571
12,"Sue, please read the article again.  These discussions with primary care physicians are about planning what types of services and supports one wants at the end of life.  In the absence of a living will and advanced care directive, my mother who passed away more than 10 years ago could very well have be kept on a ventilator and feeding tube and in a coma for years by well meaning family members and medical staff who had no clue as to what she would have wanted.<br/>End of planning provides dignity and respects individuals and families.",0.9571
13,"Your standards are too high - is Obamacare ideal? - NO not even close<br/>Is Obamacare better than the ""system"" it replaced - YES - in spades!<br/><br/>Krugman said it was better and saved money - and he was perfectly correct",0.9516
14,"You make many valid points. However, I am not referring to emergencies. I am referring to cases of malignancy, where planning can and does take place, excessive diagnostic testing and, mostly, family demands. Cost transparency matters, but our malpractice climate, which is so liberal in NY that it is state law that encourages lawsuits and fuels patient/families beliefs that everything should be perfect, is what prevents MDs from making appropriate recommendations. If I recommend ""do not treat"" to someone I don't have a long relationship with, I guarantee I will be sued. So I suggest ""do everything."" <br/><br/>As I said, change cannot happen in a vacuum. Cost transparency. Skin in the game. Liability reform. Patient expectations.<br/><br/>Single payer, by the way, will make it worse. Unless we enact limits on care, like the other countries everyone wants to emulate. But I do not think the USA is ready for what comes with that.",0.9502
15,"Thanks, Doctor. Your responses seem reasonable, thoughtful and measured. Obviously water is the best option, but sugar-free sweeteners do, as you rightly say, eliminate hundreds of utterly empty calories a day.  Let us not, as we so often do in our dietary zeal, let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I would vastly prefer single payer to Obamacare, but I am also very glad that close to 20 million people now have health care coverage who did not before.",0.9485
16,"So you would rather that the physician who is taking care of you has been up all night doing clerical work to save the hospital money? Or that the physician caring for you did not learn about or see your particular illness because they were too busy transporting patients or labs during their time-limited training? All of this, in the setting of a doctor shortage, and complaints up to 50% of physicians are burned out (greatly affecting their care and bedside manner)?<br/><br/>It's not a matter of entitlement. It's a matter of good patient care. There was a recent study indicating that current interns spend, on average, 8 minutes per day with their patients, and upwards of 60% of their time on the computer doing tasks. This is the time when interns should be learning to be doctors, when they are supervised and taught by others, including learning from their patients. If they are spending the majority of their time doing tasks which could be done by others to save the hospital money, you are reducing greatly learning of a whole new generation of doctors, who will be soon taking care of you. Watch out what you wish for. <br/><br/>As far as overwork, doctors vs nurses should not be a zero sum game. There are many other excellent articles about the same occurring with nurses, including in the NYT. Both affect patient care and we should be advocating for the other, versus the administrators pulling down 7+ figure salaries and not doing any patient care, but who tell us to do more with less.

17,"These large rate requests are just the first step in a negotiation. <br/><br/>The requested increases will undoubtedly be trimmed back considerably, after some back-and-forth between the insurers and insurance regulators, with accompanying mood music from bloviating politicians, from editorial writers, and occasionally from the public.<br/><br/>One major factor will surely be the realization that the insurers’ early claims experience is bloated by the pent-up demand of millions of people seeing doctors after years of needing medical care they couldn’t afford; that bulge in demand will no doubt trail off over time.<br/><br/>So it’s way too early to conclude, as some Obamacare opponents have, that these inflated rate requests, “prove” that the ACA is unsustainable.<br/><br/>But it does remain dispiriting that many continue to howl for cutting off these people’s access to health care. It would of course be better, more civilized, if the Republicans devoted more effort to fixing the ACA’s flaws than in more fruitless efforts to torpedo it.<br/><br/>Also, it's worth remembering the financial markets’ judgment on this: insurance company stocks leapt several percent when the Supreme Court recently refused to gut Obamacare. <br/><br/>In other words, the financial markets see Obamacare as good for the insurers, even without the dubious premium hikes they are now requesting.",0.9433
18,"Nursing has been addressing the spiritual aspect of their patients for decades. Nursing is taught as a holistic approach to patient care, encompassing the triad of physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. I believe that this is why the concept of nursing science includes ""care"" vs medical science, which is looked upon as a ""cure"". I would love to teach medical students about this, as it is vital to include a patient's spiritual needs in their care. Much of the subject content is derived from Eastern practices and influence, vs our western medical philosophy. Let me know if a position for teaching a course on the benefits of addressing the spiritual needs of patients becomes available.",0.9432
19,"My wife was the chief of staff of the VA hospital near here.  And I'd have loved to have been able to go there instead of the privateering assembly-line gougers I had to use as a non-vet.

20,"The staggering ignorance of this legislation is matched by the lack of research by the author of the essay. The options aren't pills or pump. They're pills, easy and painless self-injection into the penis before sex, and pump. A simple phone call to Dr. Joseph Alukal, an expert in the field of ED at the NYU Langone Medical Center, would have provided the information so many men need to know. Simply, a small insulin-size vial of liquid is kept refrigerated. Syringes are provided that are as tiny as the sort used by dermatologists when they work on women's faces to drain zits. It only takes one lesson to learn to apply the injection which works extremely well in about 15 minutes. So seeing an ED doctor offers a range of options for a man to choose from, all of which are important for overall health. How did it come to be that lunatic right wing parasites in Congress invaded our bedrooms and decided whether we can have sex? I wonder if there is a connection between this law and the fact that a reported 77% of Americans who are Christians actually pray with their medical doctors? And medical schools are teaching students, Mount Sinai in Manhattan is one, to engage patients on the subject of religion and discuss it with them. This nation has great and wise religious leaders. Doctors are scientists. Let's let the doctors help people have sex once the religious counselors, or no religious counselors for those who wish none, have been consulted. ",0.9408
21,Thank you Allison for your thoughts. Very thoughtful...<br/>The system is extremely complicated and the average patient (myself included) have no idea what is appropriate or best practice. We are left to guess what might be best for our particular case. We are left having to make a choice after talking with each doctor who comes through the hospital room door; do I believe she/he knows best? Are they clear about what I am experiencing and the care I have already been given? I have no idea what the answer is but I believe that hospitals should make it very clear WHO is the lead doctor and then a patient could look to that physician for coordination of care.,0.9404
22,"While the number of people waiting for kidney increases, the amount of live donors remains flat.  I am a donor, and I do not think this is due to lack of  payment to donors, although I believe there ought to be some future healthcare arrangement.    I think it is largely because most people are unaware of the advantages of live donations, that donor surgery is laporoscopic with little downtime, and that donors and recipients no longer have to be perfect matches.   Dialysis centers are required to inform patients of all their options, but many centers are not familiar with all the current options for donors.  Dialysis patients spend 12 or more hours a week tethered to machines, are on restricted diets, often do not feel well.  The dialysis center typically tells patients the menu of treatments contains center or home based dialysis, 2 types of dialysis, and transplantation, but transplantation is very often presented as an unachievable goal.  Many dialysis centers are part of 2 national chains which make over $2.4 bil  profit/year.  It is not in their financial interest to divert patients to hospital transplant centers.  <br/><br/>When patients have the oportunity to meet successfully transplanted people,  get up-to-date facts on transplantation,  and are encouraged to develop a support network to help identify possible donors, many likely chose transplantation.

23,"""Families should realize that this time is the end of life, and they should pay attention to its quality just as they would if the patient were dying at home.""  Yes, patients, families, doctors, and nurses should indeed realize this and be attune to what they can do ahead of time to prevent the daily abuse of patients by using technology to prolong the dying process in the ICU.  This is best accomplished by having ""the conversation"" well ahead of time and documenting values and wishes, and completing a POLST form when applicable.<br/><br/>Also, a well done family conference in the ICU can prevent unnecessary intubation, heart shocks, etc. (see <a href=""http://digitalcommons.hamline.edu/hlr/vol36/iss2/13/)"" title=""http://digitalcommons.hamline.edu/hlr/vol36/iss2/13/)"" target=""_blank"">http://digitalcommons.hamline.edu/hlr/vol36/iss2/13/)</a>.

24,"While I feel empathy for the author's plight and the severity of his mental illness, I feel even more outrage that he has been trapped in therapy for 45 years, having merely exchanged one addiction for another, substituted one attachment for another, and has essentially purchased from his therapist that which he could not create in his personal life. When one has a moment of crisis and one's life partner/spouse etc. is right by one's side and one calls out the name of one's therapist, at the very least a red flag should appear.<br/><br/>Therapy ideally should help us to engage in every aspect of our lives, fully and hopefully with much courage. Long-term therapeutic relationships often have the opposite effect, as the author illustrates here. Rather than the therapist empowering her client, she (despite what I'm sure are her best intentions), has made him dependent on her, dare I say, enabling him to avoid acting in the moment as he life unfolds, finding the answers in the quotidian events/relationship of his life.<br/><br/>Therapy should be a means to ends - one end being that one no longer has the need to go to therapy, but feels that that relationship has provided one with the clarity to do what one NEEDS to do in one's life, to persevere in the face of uncertainty and insecurity, for find meanings and purpose that allow happiness to ensue.

25,"Year over year spending reductions in the MSSP (trend-based model) are difficult, if not impossible.  The most inefficient systems had the most to gain - and saved - but struggled to continue those operational efficiencies year over year.  Additionally, hospital-based ACOs have struggled even more, because their top line revenue is driven by utilization and admissions, and thye just aren't cutting it long term.  It's too hard for them.  MSSP is a modified FFS+, and it's just not enough to illicit substantive change.  Of course it's a start, but many of these organizations are finding it's just too difficult to facilitate positive behavior change in such a tumultuous environment.  Also, it's a disservice to readers that most studies do not include investment costs of an ACO (some estimate 1.5M initially, and 1M every year after) when they are judging their ability to reduce costs.

Thus, we see strong resistance on the part of our own medical community to allow trained professionals to administer services for which licensed doctors charge money in a protected market; and similar resistance on the part of our legal community to allow non-lawyers to provide the form-juggling that constitutes by far the lion’s share of most legal services.<br/><br/>So, increasing the availability of abortion related skills in India threatens the economic interests of those who practice “allopathic” medicine, the modern form of the general discipline to which the world has decidedly moved.

How much are my husband and I liable for?"" she asked. The answer she got was: The full amount until you have paid the $10,000 deductible. This is more than they could afford. Although they were hoping to move here this summer, this gave them second thoughts. In Germany, they have single-provider health care (by the state or nation: I'm not sure), for which they pay taxes. which they do not begrudge for they receive value for it.

They take enormous pride in occasionally being right and use the shards of broken pieces resulting from bad policy to punish their enemies.  Conservatives would cease to exist without enemies or their own bad policy decisions resulting in broken systems.  <br/><br/>The PPACA is a failure in that the Supreme Court has managed to use conservative tenets to damage what little good the program does.  We can only hope Thune and his fellow travelers prevail in tossing six million people off the roles of the insured to meet their ideological preferences.  I doubt large private insurers will allow that to happen.  <br/><br/>Market segmentation designed to protect for profit insurers is the problem with America's health care model.  Why do we have public Medicaid, Medicare and a VA system if not to prevent private insurers assuming the burden of caring for the most vulnerable and expensive health care sub-populations?   Private profit and public loss is another bedrock conservative principle.  Socialism is only useful when bailing out failed speculators, corrupting open markets or providing propaganda talking points.

By ending the ""preexisting conditions"" nonsense but making insurance coverage mandatory, the insurance pool expands to a point where healthcare providers can no longer hide behind regional differences, or duopolies, or anything else.

If you are collecting Social Security Retirement, having done so before full retirement age, you make too little money to be in an ACA plan and therefore would be eligible for Medicaid under the ACA expansion, but you appear to live in Texas, and your current and former governors were not receptive to having the Feds pay 90% of that programs costs.  Your story doesn't hold up, except the part about your mother.  We experienced the same with my mother's recent hospitalization; too many tests unrelated to her problem that resulted in the hospitalization.  But you'd have to blame the hospitals on this one.  They employ hospitalists (independant contractors, not hospital employees).  This is a very convenient way for hospitals to absolve themselves of messy malpractice suits...the burden now falls on the hospitalists and their own insurer.  Of course they are going to run more tests when they carry the malpractice burden.  But what is especially devious and cynical, is that the hospitals are pulling in the $ for these unneeded tests.

An offer to pay for everything, to offer compensated time off for the treatment, recovery, and even the existing phobia, would not be remiss, if you really expect this to go without a fight. From experience, I can tell you that surgery for even one implant is a drawn-out, painful affair, consisting of multiple appointments and recovery time between each visit. It may include cadaver bone grafts (with their own disease risk), gum surgery and resection, antibiotics, and of course, it goes without saying, pain and possible infection and reinfection, and the unpredictability of the charges and care needed going forth. There will likely also be necessary orthodontic appliances -- existing remaining teeth may have to be moved, reshaped, or removed.

Having completed my residency yesterday (woohoo!), I feel strongly most duty hour limitations do not support what's best for patients or best for training. The abuses of training ""in the old days"" when trainees worked barbaric shifts with brief moments to pass out and maybe shower before returning for more are unacceptable. But moving 180 degrees in the other direction isn't acceptable either. Disease processes don't respect 16-hour shifts. A well-trained physician in almost every specialty should see what happens in a patient's course over 30 hours in an ICU. More importantly, when trainees are asked to make decisions when tired and overwhelmed, they learn. And mostly, they learn to do the right thing. A main purpose of training is to develop of a keen sense of judgment. The introduction of shift work has perpetuated an idea that medicine is just a job and that trainees are widgets with interchangeable capabilities. Neither is true. Practicing medicine is a privilege and residency an apprenticeship, an opportunity to learn and work towards mastery of a seemingly unmasterable volume of information and skills. That can't be done well with duty hour limits. With oversight, the ACGME should allow training programs to extend duty hours when patient care AND learning are best served. ",-0.9549
212,"Important healthcare perspectives are presented in this article regarding acute care and eventual ""delayed death"". However, medicine might holds itself to blame because of the dividing line really between illness and wellbeing.  Illness is a highly specialized knowledge base and knowhow is closely held. The keepers are physicians and nurses and technicians that hold all the techniques and truths to themselves. The standards are not discussed in pubic nor vetted by outsiders.  Drugs are regulated and care is delivered by healthcare professionals and not by the sick and injured.  It is a closed system and illness care is controlled by the MD and the institution but not by love ones or families.  It is improper to suggest that sink or swim decisions are being directed or questioned by familes.  ICU staffs are typically in control much more so than not. There are not two signs at the door of the ICU that reads: ""Real ICU"" or ""Endgame ICU"": you choose?.  Further there are no real pathways for individual direction even regarding wellbeing and/or owning your own biological information.  No twenty year old can ""out-of-pocket"" orders and pay for their own MRI (as a baseline) to measure wellbeing because the control of the technology belongs to medicine and medicine alone.  The point is that medicine is a 100% closed shop and participation in wellbeing is limited to anything except illness or deeper biological data.

If DCIS diagnosis and subsequent treatment were effective as a way to prevent death from breast cancer, we would expect the rate to be lower. The fact that the rate is the same suggests it is not effective as a way to prevent death from breast cancer. As researchers cited in the article state, it would be more helpful to also have a study that compares a group of DCIS-diagnosed women who do not undergo treatment with a group that does.
