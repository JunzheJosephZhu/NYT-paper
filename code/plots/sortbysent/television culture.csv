Why does every movie (not ""film"") have to MEAN something?<br/><br/>I love watching what I like to call ""grown-up movies"" but once in awhile, it's nice to put the brain in idle and just enjoy the thrill of being eight years old again, and I'm sure many viewers agree.",0.9923
1,"How many times did they mention the name CBS it ridiculous also the endless amount of commercials more than usual<br/><br/>Chenoweth and Cumming were really good, funny, authentic and they shared a natural effortless comedic camaraderie, they should seriously think about writing a sitcom TV series together and pitching it to A&amp;E I believe it would work, I know I would watch these 2 together again<br/><br/>Some of the winners speeches were disappointing except for Cerveris, Sharp, Gold etc.<br/><br/>I don't get Helen Mirren talent? I just don't - wins why?<br/><br/>In Memoriam what a mess - camera work - song should not have upstaged those amazing talents that passed on, the camera focus should have been right on those faces - who conceived this? in fact no song is necessary here<br/>silence is necessary for In Memoriam<br/><br/>All Winners should have been announced live, Mackintosh, Tune, sound, music score, music book, lighting, scenic design IMPT crafts that should not be tossed and diminished<br/><br/>The fashion choices looked dignified and understated<br/><br/>Enough please with the Jersey Boys really every year the Jersey Boys?<br/><br/>Some of the titles of those plays – where do they get those titles....<br/><br/>Tony Yasbeck should have won the Tony even though I like Cerveris <br/><br/>Good to see Rita Wilson, brave woman, wish her well!",0.9889
2,"""Jon Stewart Signs Off From ‘Daily Show’ With Wit and Sincerity""<br/><br/>This article put me into a bit of a melancholic mood. I used to watch The Daily Show almost everyday ever since eighth grade to get at least some knowledge on current events. I didn't always understand Mr. Stewart's puns or jokes. But most of the time I let out a laugh or a smirk because of his amazing ability to make a serious manner into a playful shout at fixing U.S. problems. As evidence by his ""good bye"" speech, his word choice is always thought provoking yet satisfying. I will miss watching him point out flaws in the Republican party or the U.S. in general. I hope I see more of him soon.",0.9806
3,"My wife and I got on a plane to Washington to attend Jon's Rally to Restore Sanity. It didn't, of course, but it helped us keep our own sanity to be among so many people who had been similarly inspired. <br/><br/>Whenever the show descended into jokes about male body parts, or sycophantic celebrity interviews, I would ask myself why I still watch. And then he would do something brilliant. <br/><br/>Bravo Jon for all those great shows, and bravissimo for stepping down with style and grace at the top of your game. ",0.978
4,"I couldn't decide which I like better, Veep or Silicon Valley. But this finale, which was superb, won me over. The sight of TJ Miller's Bachmann throwing on his carpal-tunnel brace and sitting down to code with his hair in girl clips was the peak. A hilarious sight gag inside a wonderful episode of a brilliant show.",0.9771
5,"Richard is such a tool that this episode almost turned me off from the show. There are only so many times that you can see such an idiot in action. <br/><br/>One could very easily see a spin off show called Gilfoyle, in the same way Saul Goodman got his (never saw that show but loved BB). <br/><br/>I know nothing of starting up a company but have friends who have and if you have a blockbuster product from the get go then yes maybe you can retain full control but if you are struggling initially then it could be very easy to sell yourself to get the money you need and then good things happen later and its not really your company anymore; so I don't think its implausible.

6,"Hdb, Good luck with your tech idea and company. Maybe you should find a trustworthy guy with the CEO qualifications and then be the CTO and have best of both worlds.<br/><br/>You might find that recommendation condescending since you think vicious, pushy behavior is distasteful. Fair enough, but we confuse kindergarten etiquette with the real world at our own peril. Remember who makes more money, hence better quality of life and opportunities in life - kindergarten teachers or the jerks who run corporations? And who made that happen? All of us did.<br/><br/>A better and more thoughtful explanation is provided in the most recent episode of ""Happyish"" on Showtime. The episode is #5, ""Starring Josey Wales, Jesus Christ and the NYTimes"". Bradley Whitford's character explains to Steve Coogan's character how each of us came into this world. <br/><br/>That show itself is a bit moody and brooding, but some of the writing in these shows is really impressive.

8,"Thank you for preserving the story of how this amazing revolution started, and the discussions inside Kodak during those times.<br/><br/>It is indeed ironic that the company that developed the digital camera was putting itself out of business by doing so.  Yet film, and wonderful as it was, had to go.<br/><br/>And I believe the world is so much richer for it.<br/><br/>Many photos of rare events that have been captured because everyone has a camera in their pocket now, along with videos of weather events, of natural beauty, of accidents, and of course human interactions, some beautiful and some tragic and deadly.<br/><br/>Thanks Mr. Sasson for your work and ideas.

9,"I don't have a television and rarely watch anything online but I did get hooked on Rae's wonderful Misadventures series. I suspected that Rae did not have a typical upbringing and her experience navigating between different cultures surely contributed to making this entertaining series. I feel depressed but not surprised to read that they wanted to cast another lighter skinned, straight hair women for the TV adaption but I am happy to read that Rae refused to sell out. I look forward to seeing Rae's future work. Thank you NY Times for this interesting profile.",0.9623
10,"This is a beautiful film featuring a splendidly talented cast. But I couldn’t help notice that it was also an unwittingly perfect example of the narrow White perspective being portrayed as a significant stumbling block to healing and equality in our country’s current dialogue about race and privilege.<br/><br/>What originally tipped me off wasn’t the all-White main cast or the fact that the few people of color in this film were mainly serving cocktails and checking out groceries. It was the fact that the film centered around a lush green Southern California golf course during a disastrous 4-year drought facing the area (3 years in at the time of filming). Then came the almost too-ironic-to-be-true scene depicting White women getting pulled over by the police and getting away with their illegal “antics” by amusing the officer.<br/><br/>A year ago, I might not have noticed any of this. As an avid film festival attendee, I’ve delighted in dozens of “all-White” independent films that exquisitely dramatize my emotional truth.<br/><br/>But we are living in different times thankfully, and against the backdrop of the current discussion about the legacy of majority culture and its unending impact on minority lives, “I’ll See You in My Dreams” felt so out of touch that it could have been a satirical portrayal of the incredibly narrow perspective of the White, affluent class – in this case, Baby Boomers who are facing loss and dying but who, more significantly, seem sheltered from how most of the world lives.",0.9581
11,".<br/>.<br/>Please INDULGE ME for a couple of remarks about JFC's avatar for Thursday's puzzle, inspired by Charles's favorite movie, ""LAURA"".<br/><br/>I have seen all the Oscar-winning Best Pictures, many of which were superb; and in my estimation, one of the 10 best winners of that award was ""Best Years of Their Lives"" with Dana Andrews, Frederic March, and a whole lot of other talent.  I have no idea what impact it made when it was playing in the theaters, but when I saw it 40+ years later, I thought it was an incredibly important document (although it was mostly fictional).<br/><br/>And I guess it goes without saying that I find it better than ""LAURA"", as good as that film is.<br/><br/>But back to Dana Andrews: I have now read all of Thursday's comments and am not sure how to feel about no one remarking, ""Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes, and passing them used lots of skills"".  (Movie reference: ""Night of the Demon"", re-released as part of a double feature using the name ""Curse of the Demon"".)<br/><br/>People I thought might mention the lyric include spenyc, arcoiris, and especially Jimbo.  I thought HalinNY may have caught a midnight movie in Uniondale a time or 2 as well.<br/><br/>Well, what's done is done!<br/><br/>This version is from the gimmick TV series ""Glee"".

12,"First ladies may not be paid directly, but it is a pretty good gig. Big House. Big Staff. Expense account. The Airplane.  Instant celebrity, which is a negotiable commodity.  And all of the Ladies that I can recall were given huge book contracts. It's not for everyone, but few would consider it exploitation.<br/><br/>I am surprised, however, that the writer wouldn't want Bill Clinton, should Hillary win, to assume the role of First Gentleman, or First Lad. What a shock that would be to the country--to cast a former president in a secondary and ceremonial role.  I suppose the real question is, could Bill could do it?

15,"Agreeing with those critical of the staging of the Memoriam. There was a simple, beautiful, elegant idea– the combined casts of all nominated musicals, performing together, respecting their predecessors– was compromised and diminished. And Josh Groban? Really? Why not Bernadette Peters? Patti Lupone? Someone appropriate for the moment, at least. Take a cue from the most emotionally resonant productions of recent years: Fun Home, Curious Incident, and Next To Normal. Keep it simple, informed by the idea of the thing. Groban was neither of these and he croaked. ",0.9506
16,"Coolhunter, it's telling that you use the ""Elf on a Shelf"" as your icon.  Like the elf, Trump is nothing but a fantasy character.  He is, like the elf, a stuffed characterization of a fairy tale, propped up by the fear of small minds.  There is absolutely no truth or honesty to his being; both Trump and the elf are creations of the imagination - the former from the imagination of a twisted narcissism, and the latter, a story told to young children to encourage good behavior in the days before Christmas.

Good taste (and clever comments) do not make for an accurate measure of popular desire.<br/><br/> ""Fandango reports that 50% of its ticket sales today were for Warner Bros.’ Entourage.

22,"Megyn Kelly asked Donald Trump about some of the ‘horrible’ things he’s said to women. In that question, she said this among her line-up of insults:<br/>“You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.” Now the way that statement was framed by Kelly implies that Trump was being sexually suggestive, alluding that it would be a pretty picture to see that contestant on her knees…you know. But that’s not what happened at all. In the clip from Celebrity Apprentice, Brett Michaels was explaining to Trump that Brande Roderick didn’t want to get fired and had gotten down on her knees and begged not to be fired.<br/>Trump responded “excuse me, you dropped to your knees?” Roderick responded “Yes.”<br/>Then Trump joked “must be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.”<br/>Trump was joking about something that had already occurred. He wasn’t suggesting she get down on her knees or that it would be pretty if she did.<br/>Now maybe the joke was inappropriate. But Brande Roderick doesn’t think so.

23,"The continuing attention to the role of first lady is cringe-worthily reminiscent of monarchy worship.  We, too, need our queens and princesses, as evidenced by our continuing fascination with royal weddings and royal pregnancies and royal babies and royal maternity/infant fashion.<br/><br/> Does anybody really believe that the presidential spouse functions as anything more than a retro P.R. royal to charm and appease the masses? Like any aristocrat/celebrity, she has a huge staff to perform such odious tasks as invitation-writing, flower-arranging and speech-writing.<br/><br/>And first ladies also act as diversions from unpopular, corrupt administrations. They engage in such heartwarming and attention-getting initiatives as reading, healthy foods and supporting the troops while their hubbies wage their misbegotten wars and shill for job-destroying trade deals. Laura Bush, for one, remained beloved throughout her White House tenure, despite her marriage to a guy whom many have judged to be the worst president ever (though now that he's been out of power awhile, his popularity is starting to strangely rise. So much for the memory skills of the American people.)<br/><br/>The media doesn't help either, with its insipid portrayal of first ladies as mannequins. From Hillary's hairstyles to Michelle's bangs and blowouts, these women do not so much influence as they ""stun"" and ""wow"" in their designer clothes.<br/><br/>First ladies, wittingly or not, serve mainly to aid and abet an oligarchic power structure.",0.9365

32,"As much as I love and admire Jon Stewart, and enjoy his critiques of news media - especially CNN - I still think this particular anecdote is unfair to CNN. John King interviewed Jon Kyle live, whereas Jon Stewart critiqued the interview after the fact, with the benefit of substantial staff research. King did not know in advance what Kyle would say, so that he could send staff researchers off to look into it.<br/><br/>That distinction illustrates a much more serious flaw in conventional news presentation that Jon Stewart demonstrated almost every night. CNN and other participants in the 24/7 news cycle are obsessively focused on delivering viewers the absolutely newest breaking news. Once the Kyle interview was done, it was likely never mentioned on CNN again.<br/><br/>The Daily Show, on the other hand, is not live, but taped, and not 24/7 but just 88 minutes a week. Stewart is not, and could not possibly be, in competition with the 24/7 outlets to deliver the latest tidbit of alleged information. Stewart is able to research that tidbit, consider its history and context, and develop a considered - and almost always hilarious - analysis of it.<br/><br/>What 24/7 news outlets can learn from Jon Stewart is that most of the time, the absolutely newest factoid is not really important, and CNN could more profitably spend much of its time reflecting on things that happened earlier this week, and not always focus on what happened earlier this minute.<br/><br/><a href=""http://politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com"" title=""politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com"" target=""_blank"">politicsbyeccehomo.wordpress.com</a>",0.9226

70,I'm a little disappointed that Cait isn't simply allowed to be trans. Ive listened to a lot of the criticism of the show and it seems that most of it revolves around browbeating her into a specific kind of advocacy. Sometimes the most powerful statement is just being yourself. Unfortunately I don't think a lot of the other viewpoints on the show carry an understanding of this. We hear repeatedly about how she is supposed to show respect or stand up for  other Trans celebrity figures who were unable to rise to her level of success. She is told at one point she should even call out the nebulous figures who are responsible for this. We are told over and over again that Cait is passively responsible for this by profiting off of the status that was actually deserved by others. She is portrayed almost as some sort of thief. Some of these people seem to think that they should be famous and glamorous simply because they are trans. They seem to forget that Cait was already famous (have any of them competed in the Olympics?)  and simply happened to be Trans. Over and over again the other people attempt to make her feel guilty about her success. It was the most unappealing part of the show. This is supposed to be a reality TV show about Cait. If the viewers wanted to watch shows about the lives (and complaints) of b list trans celebrities ... they already would be. ,0.7841

In particular, ""Vacation"", which was released last week on July 29 by Warner Bros. Roughly around the same time in 2013, Warner Bros. released ""We're the Millers"", a raunchy comedy that made $37.9 million over it's first five days in theatres. ""Vacation"" on the other hand, has only made $22.8 million so far, plus it was poorly received by film critics and audiences alike. This movie has now been added to the list of 2015's unsuccessful, R-rated comedies like: “Entourage,” “Magic Mike XXL”, ""Ted 2"", ""Get Hard"", and “Hot Tub Time Machine 2”. So what's the deal with all of these failing comedies this year? Not only did all of the movies listed above fail at the box office, they received negative reviews from critics. Also, Magic Mike XXL, Ted 2, and ""Hot Tub Time Machine 2"", were sequels that nobody really wanted. I will say that the R-rated comedies that did do well this year, (""Spy"", ""Dope"" &amp; ""Train wreck"") received positive reviews from critics and earned a decent amount at the box office. On top of that, comedies that are released around the same time as action movies, like with  ""Vacation"" and ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"", they tend to always bomb at the box office, regardless of what their critical reviews were.

My personal favorite film critic, Roger Ebert, famously panned Blue Velvet, in part because he was so powerfully affected by the degradation suffered by Rosselini's character. Of course, this was part of Lynch's design. Other films like Inland Empire and Lost Highway were largely ignored and now are actually difficult for new, younger audiences to find. This is a shame, because each of these films, are masterful in their own rights and deserve the chance to inspire fledgeling filmmakers.

He was good, brave &amp; all a hero should be (just like Rob, but I kept watching after Rob was gone, because I could still root for Jon.)<br/>1.)  The #1 reason I am done w/GOT- Killing characters i was rooting for now seems gratuitous, like HBO/Martin are killing them just because they can.  This is a work of fiction, but isn't the whole point of fiction to tell a story with a point?  To follow characters that the reader is invested in?  Caring about the surviving Stark members &amp; even a faint hope of reunion was a big part of the story, at least for me, &amp; now we have a  Westeros w/o Starks? HBO/George- do what you want with the remaining cast.  I am done.  ",-0.9869
250,"I thought for a sec this finale was about what Jeremy says in the recap about the many against the few, except we have a teocracy in Kings Landing- look how bad are beaten the onlookers when they approach Cersei too close, yep that's the power of the few over the many.<br/>The whole North scenario went south ( not literally, except for the smart Sam ).<br/>So, Melisandre is not that unmistaken sorceress. Who could it believe that? None.<br/>Jon Snow is dead?! Yes, if Melisandre wasn't there. Do you remember Beric Dondarrien of the -it's not a pun- Brotherhood without banner? He was killed by the Hound and revived for the 7th, SEVENTH time. So, i suspend my belief on that until next season, if GRRM will come back on supervising, due to the poor job the writers did this season.<br/>Stannis is dead? Probably, yes. Much more than Jon could be. Brienne is not the mother of mercy, but, again talking about the writers poor job, i missed the epic entirely this season, except for Tyrion&amp;Varys conversations. What about make her tell ""Renly Baratheon, bla bla bla... and i sentenced you to die by this Valyrian blade named Oathkeeper!"". O.k. that's what i call a 100% sure death. And an epic one. Of the best warmonger of seventh kingdom. Why do they give us a killing more apt to a minor character? Unless it was not that. And if that the case, a writers' poorer job.",-0.9872
