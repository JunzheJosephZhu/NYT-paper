Now that we have climate change out of the way, let's take up another one of his Papal opinions and finally outlaw abortion which is the murder of the unborn!  Wait, where'd everybody go?  Religion is not meant to be a convenient thing folks, and don't put the man on a pedestal unless you're willing to buy the entire package.  But then again, environmentalists do have a rich history of cherry picking their advocates.  Anybody remember Ira Einhorn?  The wonderful founder of EarthDay, who also kept the decomposing body of his girlfriend in a trunk in his apartment.  So love the Pope and his strong messages for the faithful, but remember that those messages are not meant to be a Chinese Menu",0.9838
1,"Dear Mr.Edsall,<br/>                      Thank you for a courageous article.There is a major struggle going on in America &amp; around the world, it is the struggle between the secular &amp; religious.First we must define secular.Not all secular thinking people denounce a higher power, but we prefer to keep that higher power out of our bedrooms &amp; government, &amp; support a distinct separation between Church &amp; State.If the Church wins this battle, our progress in Science &amp; Medicine, will be curtailed ,such as when Bush put limitations on Stem Cell research.The surge of young people pursuing higher education has been a boom to openness and questioning, with the result in the equality of life for the Gay community.Gay Marriage would have been unthinkable 50 years ago.Inter marriage is on the rise, as the young put love before dogma, in spite of the raving from the pulpits, &amp; grand parents.Progress &amp; love is flourishing in all facets of humanity, except where the hold of fanatical religious fervor has an Iron hold on reason.As one who has a Higher Power, I pray for this continuous<br/>progress towards enlightenment.",0.9808
2,A good thing for bringing attention to and acceptance of those who decide they must at last honor the person they are inside. Of course this is the ultimate freedom- to be who we are.<br/>And we should honor that absolutely.<br/>Acceptance and honor their decision.<br/><br/>But my next thought is... God I'm so tired of the celebrity world.<br/>When will we ever get a break from having these self-important folks shoved in our faces?<br/><br/>I long for people like Paul Newman whose modesty was as great as his talents.,0.9803
3,"Mary came up pregnant without having had Biblical knowledge of her husband Joseph. But she was much more imaginative than Bristol Palin. Jesus and his  chosen 12 male disciples partied, drank wine and dined while on a three year sabbatical that ended in doubting fearful forsaken crucifixion. Did they lust mentally and physically while enjoying the pleasures of the human flesh? Abraham, David, Moses and Muhammad were husbands, lovers and fathers. <br/><br/>The problem with the appeal of rhetorical divine faithful purity is the not so divine biological animal primate ape  real practical quest for salt, sugar, fat, sex, water, kin, habitat and food. Unless there is a resurrection or return of  a Messiah coupled with divine judgment then we are full of exceptional hubris living in delusional denial. ",0.9793
4,"Jesus was a radical, not a conservative. Just as he ate with tax collectors and talked with strange, unconventional women, defending their rights to life and -freedom in 1st century Palestine, he would celebrate same-sex unions and demand that we continue to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and care for the planet in 21st Century America. Just as he said that 'the laborer is worthy of HIS wage' back then, he would say that so is SHE today. His life and teachings were all about compassion (which, literally, means shared suffering), love, helping those who are in any kind of need, upholding the basic dignity of every individual - no matter how lowly or depraved they may have become - and looking to working out one's OWN salvation while sharing the good news with others. He never said to beat anyone over the head with the Bible, or shame them into silence, he said to set an example and invite (not force) others to follow.<br/>When the mainline churches get around to implementing this, then they will prosper again.",0.9783
5,"I used to make up little adages.  One that stands out said: ""Freedom Without Sin"".       Throughout America's history, immigration has consisted of people seeking a new life here, and it seems people took the full meaning of living a life well, more seriously back in earlier times.  They came, usually already having a moral code they followed.    But today they come to an America that has tended, by way of laws passed, and especially by way of judicial decisions, to scorn moral codes in favor of a new way of looking at freedom.   <br/><br/>It has come to mean a base, degenerate, kind of freedom, a freedom even form any religious or other meaningful and actually respected, kind of guides to living.<br/>Life at the same time has lost its guides to material influence, the influence of a culture dominated too much by devotion to material and money value.   Subjected to bombardment daily by a media with its abundant commercials, and shows on TV that reflect the same crassness.<br/><br/>Granted that there is yet through media and other means, an attempt to counteract this, it exerts its relentless war against basic adherence to the earlier values.<br/>And granted that earlier values need to be kept up to date, something they provided is yet being warred against, while then the country's basic values are being degraded ever faster.   And now the immigrants don't even perceive a good reason to come to America except basically, for the money.  This is very sad.",0.9677
6," Belief systems and the language needed to integrate  one's ethics and morality within the world are shifting indeed. Think of all the kids in our G7/8/9 cultures that grow up trained only the quotidian materialism of economic survival and its rewards.   The market place is the invisible hand of God. A materialistic belief system  without any responsibility to our fellow human beings.<br/>Midrash, the ability to interpret our traditions for a contemporary society, I believe, is the only way to save religion from itself.  Christianity is locked in a archaic defilement of what Jesus taught us.  Something I think Conservatives need to consider for the benefit of their souls.<br/>There is no one Christian Church view about  social redemption. It's mercy and love which is required of us all. ",0.9657
7,"American pluralism is definitely her strength - Republican Party does not share this narrative. The coded narrative of American Exceptionalism of Republican Party is the subtle message of White superiority. And new narrative of this story is the ""anchor baby"". <br/><br/>Since the elimination of Jim Crow, Republican Party systematically using coded message to propagate their devisive narrative - Republican Presidential candidate Bobby Jinxle is a powerful sign of pluralism. He can not position  himself as an Indian American, as American only. <br/><br/>The same issue is not there for California AG - she is a democratic candidate for Senate as Indian American.Republican Party following the Putin doctrine in US politics.",0.9584
8,"For some reason it has become a truism that religious or faith-based judgements are somehow more noble or more deserving of respect than any other kind of judgement or decision. Why should this be so? Why is the freedom to express a religious belief or a religious practice more in need of protection or respect than any other kind of belief or practice? Personally, I don't think it is.<br/><br/>In fact, I think the very REASON we have a secular society is so that religions with competing claims and beliefs (or indeed sects within ""a religion"") can co-exist, without some kind of government institution adjudicating. Instead, we enforce a set of secular rules based on principles enshrined in our constitution. As long as religions operate within those bounds, they are fine. If they violate them (hey, we'd like to sacrifice a virgin!) then they are against the law. I don't really see the problem with that. <br/><br/>Often times, the ""freedom"" the religious people seem to want is the freedom to make everyone else conform to their religion.",0.9553
9,"Socrates, I hope that your optimism and the sunny forecast for Iran's engagement in the civilized world will occur. I remind myself that there is such a huge difference between what we are accustomed to in the Western World in a country (among other countries) whose foundations are based on English Common Law, the Magna Carta, and practice fundamental honesty without cultural bribery, treachery, and graft; versus what we see practiced in totalitarian and theocratic nations composed of tribes and, by our standards, of fundamentally dishonest and inhumane people.  Are we ""perfect?"" Far from it. But, unlike many nations or tribal associations, I am buoyed by the knowledge that we are continuing to progress and to strive for a better life..not only for ourselves but for the generations who will succeed us.",0.9538
10,"I'm not a Catholic, and never thought much of the Catholic church, which has probably committed as much evil as any other organization, ever.<br/><br/>That said, I love Pope Francis.  His message is simple: the greatest good is to love your fellow man. In comparison, money and the material possessions it buys are nothing.  <br/><br/>This is not Marxism, as some posters here (and elsewhere) have contended; it is Christ's message, delivered and heard long before Karl Marx lived and wrote.  <br/><br/>James, Ed, Jon -- Perhaps what you are resisting is the idea that Karl Marx's collectivism is so Christian that when the Pope talks like Jesus did, you think he sounds like Marx.",0.9531
11,"""Control"" is the operative issue.    Freedom is a social norm driven by the needs of society as a whole, and the ""spectrum of perceived personal freedoms"" is always in opposition to those needs.<br/><br/>This forces us, as a society, to continuously walk the balanced beam of ""social norm"", while attempting to satisfy our individual perceptions of ""personal freedoms"".<br/><br/>Prisons are a good micro-cosmic example of how this works when we 'over reach' in our attempts to constrain ""personal freedoms"".    On the other hand, the US Constitution with it's built-in tolerance for the spectrum of human behavior (including criminal and corrupt behavior) is probably our best example of 'balance within reason'.<br/><br/>Society doesn't grant outliers such as 'natural born killers' the personal freedom to act out their 'nature', but some segment within society that needs some killing to be done may find a use for them.    The ""perceived personal freedoms"" of the ""those who may use them"" justifies their need for the ""natural born killers"".<br/><br/>We as a society have a clear unified opinion about what to do with the 'natural born' killers, but clarity starts to 'blur' once levels of abstraction are introduced.    Bosses rarely suffer the full or immediate consequences of their use of 'natural born killers'.<br/><br/>Social norms have evolved to 'channel' rather than control behavior, but the 'nature' of the universe and we, within it, cannot yet eliminate the existence of outliers.   Control is a perception not a fact.",0.9507
12,"I like him.   I like the Pope too.   No one's proselytizing here!   He speaks for peace - perhaps he's MARKETING peace, how subversive.   It's great to have him show up at Glastonbury.   For Joe and Jill and me this makes the world seem a better place.",0.945
13,"The nation was founded by people who weren't fervent believers but went through the motions to mollify those for whom there is a divine spark in every occurrence, those like Rick Perry who pray for rain and those like Ted Cruz who blame Texas flooding on Native American rain dances. <br/><br/>The Supreme Court decided forty years ago that women retained the right to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Unless the current Supremes under the Dread Justice Roberts would like to revisit this issue, that's the law that should be adhered to in every State.<br/><br/>Texas, Idaho, and other red states have put religious bullying ahead of the law. Is that their right? My religion, which is that all religions, including mine, are presumptuous folly, would start by asking preachers to clam up in public. Even so, should my godless ilk become a majority we understand the disparity between public and private behavior. Preach all you want to your coterie on the Eternity Express. Just keep your hands off the law.<br/><br/>For that's the rub here: The law is supposed to be just to believers and non-believers alike. Reconsider that last statement in a country that allows churches tax benefits and behavioral latitudes it would not extend to non-church groups and activities. To wit: Two proximate day care centers in Mississippi, one church-run and the other not, faced radically different conditions; the religious one was not taxed or regulated.<br/><br/>Separate church and state.

They still manage to come up with an ""explanation"" so they do not have to abandon prior beliefs.<br/><br/>The surprise isn't so much all of the wrong-headed thinking that's out there; the real surprise is that we manage to have people who are honest and speak the truth consistently guided by empiricism.<br/><br/>Galileo would have been your friend, Dr. K!   :-)",0.9371
16,"""...But I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting in the political realm.”  I certainly hope that Jeb Bush is able to convince his coreligionists and fellow conservatives that church and state ought to be hermetically from each other, and that they will cease efforts to legislate religion in matters of reproductive policy or marriage laws. Otherwise, all this amounts to is cherry-picking which religious views they like and repudiating all the rest. So much for a clear and consistent philosophy of religion!",0.932
17,"As the Islamic terrorist group, ISIS, creeps closer to dismantling not only the ancient stones of Palmyra, but the history held within those stones, a fear builds up in the minds of those who care for the ancient site. The famous emperor Augustus once stated, “I found Rome an empire of bricks and left it an empire of marble,”. This hints in the notion that Rome was meant to last forever, marble takes longer to disintegrate into the past much faster than bricks. Yet even if the marble crumbles to dust from a force gaining strength, the memory would not be dust but very much alive. If the world does not wish to forget, it won’t. Especially with how quickly word spreads through social media and the news.<br/>“They were willing to gamble reinforcements and take serious casualties in order to destroy these stones, which they view as idols to false gods,” (Symmes, 2015). It is this importance on history of a site in which a polytheistic religion once held truth in that scares ISIS. The Roman religion is not a major threat to world religions today for all of its followers died thousands of years before ISIS. However, Rome spanned territory fro-m the Iberian Peninsula all the way to Central Asia. It may be the spheres of influence that Rome was able to create that truly scares ISIS into wanting to erase that memory of Rome. If ISIS wants to appear as the most powerful “empire” in the world it must “erase” the other ones from the history books.",0.916
18,"Our founding fathers had the idea that the church had a legitimate place in society. It was not to run the government, but to raise good people to become good citizens. <br/><br/>I wish, like Pope Francis, that they would avoid focusing on abortion and contraception  and the hierarchy and pick up where Jesus left off - teaching the wonders that can come from simply ""doing unto others as you would have them do to you.""",0.9136
19,"Plato coined ""theo-logoi""--god stories--as a form of mytho-logoi--along with Aesop's Myths. Aesop was ethically virtuous and good pedagogy--inspiring children.  But the god stories Homer/Hesiod were atrocious on both counts--despite being fascinating tales.<br/><br/>Biblical god stories by comparison are--at best--a mixed bag, as noted in this report.  Women were property; wives were bought; brides unable to prove virginity were stoned to death, and so on. Yahweh's favorite homophobe, Mr Lot, impregnated his daughters after Yahweh turned his wife into a pillar of salt.  <br/><br/>Even the Pauline take on Jesus's life and death is an atrocity--spun as love--a god killed--sacrificed--his son to atone for Adam/Eve sins, thus opening the gates of heaven--to believers--submitting to church authority.  <br/><br/>Paul thus ignored the teachings of Jesus--regarding charity and love/care of neighbors--even Samaritans--inventing Christianity<br/><br/>Christians shouldn't be smug.<br/><br/>And all polities should beware of blanket ""freedom of religion.""

That said, the press too have to learn to take it on their chin. Charlie Hebdo's cartoon depiction of the Prophet Mohammed ( sacrilege to Muslims )was lauded because it was the Press Freedom and Right to make a spoof of Everything Islam although that was'nt fair to all the other peace-loving Muslims and caused them great distress.

25,"David Brooks has written nonstop about the importance of Religion, and how horrible we evil secularists are to get between a person and their ""deeply held religious beliefs.""  He's used this argument countless times as he has fought against marriage equality and women's rights.<br/><br/>as he said in March:  ""The ways of the Lord are mysterious and are understood differently by different traditions. At their best, Americans have always believed that people should have the widest possible latitude to exercise their faith as they see fit or not exercise any faith. While there are many bigots, there are also many wise and deeply humane people whose most deeply held religious beliefs contain heterosexual definitions of marriage. These people are worthy of tolerance, respect and gentle persuasion.""<br/><br/>Well, David.  ISIS is raping women according to their ""deeply held religious beliefs.""  You said it yourself, these men kneel and pray before they commit their vile actions. <br/><br/>ISIS is what happens when you tear down the Separation of Church and State.  ISIS is what happens when you give religious zealots a free pass based on some book written thousands of years... be it the Koran or Leviticus.  <br/><br/>Perhaps David will think on this the next time he defends Religious Intolerance and Bigotry we see right here in America.",0.8757
26,"So, Brooks describes christian conservatives thus: ""Social conservatives already subscribe to a faith built on selfless love. They can serve as examples of commitment. They are equipped with a vocabulary to distinguish right from wrong, what dignifies and what demeans. They already, but in private, tithe to the poor and nurture the lonely."" This delusional interpretation may explain why conservatives look upon themselves with such indignant righteousness. How does this description square with consistent denial of a life sustaining minimum wage and affordable health care for the weakest among us? Why are our for-profit jails filled to capacity with minorities convicted of minor   offenses? Why the continuing job and housing discrimination among these same minorities? The list goes on and on. Selfless love, really? Rather than claiming that social conservatives possess the above admirable qualities Brooks should try to come up with the answer to why they don't.",0.8677

As one who lives and works in ministry here in Rio, it would seem that you have to really understand the nature of pentecostalism in Brazil, the life in the ""comunidades"" (favelas) and the deep religious nature of the Brazilians in order to fully understand this child-preaching phenomenon.  While I have nothing against preaching (I am a preacher), I think it is unwise to place kids in these situations.  The majority of these churches have practically zero theologically-trained pastors, and so the services end up being long healing crusades, full of shouting, prophetic-style fortune-telling, and requests for money.  Certainly God can (and does) move in spite of it.  <br/><br/>However, the majority of these churches also have people with big hearts.  If it wasn't for the pentecostal churches in the slums, the drug trafficking trade and violence would be exponentially worse.  The government in Rio comes to the church to help solve social problems, because they have seen even statistically that the church provides a better out for a transformed man/woman than mere social programs or education. <br/><br/>So perhaps it's better to encourage a young kid to be a preacher because it avoids him/her entering the trades of drug-trafficking or prostitution.  <br/><br/>At the same time, all too often, somewhere the simplicity of the Gospel is by-stepped in the hype.",0.2732

Though converted three centuries earlier, Catholic Brahmins retained the Hindu caste system that discriminates against so-called “untouchables” even if they too were Catholic converts.  Indian bishops were rebuked by Pope John Paul II for these practices on his visit to Goa in 2003.

But there is a Jain tradition that there were prophets before Mahavira and if this is so, then Jainism is older than Buddhism.<br/><br/>In any case, what Jainism and Buddhism have in common is that they are religions which do not depend primarily on scripture but on logic and on personal experience.   This forces both religions to face up to philosophical issues which are still live (the NYU philosophers Block and Nagel come to mind).<br/><br/>The solutions to philosophical problems which Buddhism and Jainism offer may or may not be correct, but discussing them inevitably leads to philosophical sophistication.    <br/><br/>For instance Jains abhor the taking of life but know that some taking at least of plant life is needed to survive.  This results in a taxonomy of forms of life, ""which forms of life lead to a greater sin when taken?""  Thus onions and carrots are not eaten since there is no way to get the fruit without killing the plant.  But eating a peach does not kill the tree so it is less harmful to other life.<br/><br/>Many courses on philosophy of religion in the West ignore Buddhism and Jainism and concentrate on  Christianity and Judaism.

Racism is what allowed Christians who believed in heaven and hell to treat other people so unjustly while believing that they were doing the right thing. We can and should clear our country of racism, and make it one of those bad things which are over. <br/><br/>When legally enforced inequalities were replaced with the Civil Rights Laws the great boom time which enabled so many to prosper more than any previous time in history was nearly at an end, leaving a higher percentage of formerly discriminated against minorities with a much higher proportion of the poor than of other groups.

Radical Islam has embraced its most violent interpretation as being one in which real Muslims are duty-bound to engage in a perpetual ""holy war"" against the West and modernism.
