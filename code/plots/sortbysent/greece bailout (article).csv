0,"@ Chanson de Roland: ""Instead of bringing Europe together in prosperous union, the European project now divides Europe into internecine feuds, even within nations.""<br/><br/>I agree, but I would be more specific: in my view, it is the Euro which divided Europe. The EU was doing quite fine until the single currency. There was friendship between the peoples, and a rather strong friendship between the Germans and the Greeks, actually. The Germans loved the Greeks - their temperament, their hospitality, their food, their beautiful landscapes.<br/><br/>Then came the Euro, which tied everyone together in an uncomfortable and unworkable monetary union. The currency was much too hard for Greece and the other southern European economies. And while the German export economy benefitted, the average German citizen did not - he is now being paid in an under-valued currency, has less buying power on holidays abroad or for imports, and has to watch wihile has savings accounts get eaten up by low interest rates.<br/><br/>Even worse, the Euro has made the southern Europeans into borrowers and the Germans into an economic policeman, who has to insist on following the rules because of his own self-interest, but is resented for it abroad.<br/><br/>We would all be better off, in my view, if we went back to our national currencies. I'd rather see the German export economy take a hit than live in the most hated nation in Europe.<br/><br/>The EU and the Euro are not identical. One worked fairly well until the other came along.",0.9766
1,"_ Did any banker or German hold a gun to Greece's head and compelled them to lie about their nation's financial health in order to gain entry into the EU?<br/>YES! Goldman Sachs cooked the books along with Greece's then-leader to get into the EU and they should be in jail now!<br/><br/>- Did any banker or German hold a gun to Greece's when they cho(o)se to look the other way to rampant tax evasion?<br/>Ordinary Greeks have their taxes taken automatically out of their monthly paychecks, just like ordinary French people. RICH Greeks, and French, however, like many rich of other countries, have their wealth in tax havens.<br/><br/> Did any banker or German hold a gun to Greece's head when they created an unsustainable social welfare state?<br/>The Greeks were doing fine until they joined the Eurozone, as were the French. Southern Europeans should leave the Eurozone until the terms are not skewered in the favor of the wealthy ad, yes, the bankers.<br/><br/>Please read any New York Times article pertaining to Greece and/or the Euro by Krugman to have more details on these issues...",0.9755
2,"May be the Greek government should compromise with its creditors on their demand.  But it should not reduce the pension amount paid to the elderly people.  Instead, the pension will be paid out in drachma.  But the Greek government will protect the drachma so that it would not depreciate more than predetermined level every year, say 5 or 10%.  This will allow 1) Greeks people realize how much will its drachma really worth without Euro, 2) pension benefits will be reduced over time as what the creditors will want, and 3) they have their own currency ready if they truly want to get out EU.",0.9622
3,"You are certainly right about the belligerent style and it would have been smart to avoid overtly marxist terminology, which is waving a red flag (literally). <br/><br/>However one of Greece's biggest problems is non payment of taxes which reduces government revenue dramatically. If their 0.1% is anything like ours that has also reduced living wage jobs (a huge part of the profitability of US companies depends on cheap labor) and increased income inequality. Those are issues with employers, shipowners, etc that are basically soaking the middle class and below. I don't know much about Greece but if their extensive public sector employment and generous benefits are a safety net they need to finance it with progressive taxation - give tax breaks only to employers that offer jobs which replace the need for government hiring. A VAT tax is regressive, not progressive.  Varoufakis could learn a lot from Germany, whose workers are much better off, if he looked beyond the disastrous economic prescriptions being forced on Greece. If Greece showed an interest in copying what Germany does right Germany might in turn have confidence that the Greek government could resurrect the Greek economy if they got some slack ...",0.959
4,"Money is a common denominator, a means of exchange accepted by two or more parties engaging in a transaction.  It is a convenience - no more and no less.<br/><br/>And as such, the means of exchange can not be owned; just as a public roadway can not be owned but rather must serve as a means for free transit, subject only to the conditions that make free transit practical for all parties that require it.<br/><br/>The root of the problem is the current banking system.  As a common denominator, money can not be owned, nor can it be an end in itself, or used to subjugate the elected government of a sovereign nation to to whims of the owners of Greece's debt.<br/><br/>Since Greece is currently a member of the European Community, it can not print it's own currency,  Yet the EC refused to provide Greece with the currency it requires to meet the immediate needs of it's citizens without renouncing it's sovereign right to exercise the powers granted it by the citizens of Greece.<br/><br/>As a result, Greece has no choice but to leave the EC, print it's own currency and administer it's distribution in order to assure the the survival and well being of Greece's population.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Bank of Greece must not be owned nor controlled by private banking interests.  Ever, again.<br/><br/>As the seat of Western Civilization, Greece has continued showing the way.  Well done, Grecos.",0.9585
5,"""Long Live Europe""<br/><br/>The reason why I chose Roger Cohen’s column is simple: I want to spread the message, Long Live Europe; I cannot fathom that we have to fight to keep being “united in diversity”.<br/>After presenting a project on Romania’s integration into the European Union, I was asked: good or bad? I said positive, my argument was that we have someone to protect us, we have a safety net; Putin wouldn’t leave us alone if we weren’t part of the European Union, if we didn’t have 27 countries ready to help their sister in need.<br/>Romania today is fraudulent. We’re nowhere. They say at least Greece is doing worse than we are, but is that really true? Mr. Cohen says “The worst outcome for Europe would be a Greek exit from the euro,” and he’s right. He also points out that “joining the shared currency, for all nations in it, was an “irrevocable” decision”. Right once again? Maybe Greece wasn’t ready. I know we aren’t and probably never will be.<br/>Mr. Cohen reminds that “[Cameron] has promised, if re-elected, a referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union in 2017.” Migration to Britain comes in large number from countries part of the European Union. I noticed a huge negative response on social media from young people studying in the UK, many of them allowed to do so because of the advantages that the European Union offers to its people. Britain represents the American dream to many European kids.<br/>Yes, Europe is not doing well, but it is alive. And alive means opportunity.",0.9575
6,"I am so glad for the Greeks. I am hopeful the people will live a better lives in the future.

7,"Funny! The lefty economist Varoufakis, who was trying to tell the Troika that there really is an economics 101, and the ECB that it needs to act as a central bank rather than a collection agency, has gone for unknown reasons.<br/><br/>Of all the stupid comments that I have seen during this entire Troika orchestrated circus, the one which takes the cake is for Americans to ridicule the Greeks for not being able to collect taxes. In 2005 George W Bush repatriated corporate profits at a steep 5% discount, which were held outside of the US in order to evade and not avoid taxes in countries like Ireland, which has no tax liability at a cost to the Treasury of 134 billion dollars.<br/><br/>The 2014 estimate for the loss to the treasury per year is estimated at 50 billion per year. None of this cash has ever showed up as capital investment in the US Economy. Take a look at the list of Dynasty Trust States, which sets up tax free trusts in perpetuity, and then try to laugh at the Greeks for not being able to collect taxes! Hard to laugh now. Isn't it.",0.9529

9,"As I am often reminded by my Liberal friends that Spain, Greece Italy etc had thriving economies before the financial crises. Of course debt sustained  economics works wonderfully well when no variables are introduced (econ 101). But in the real world it does not work that way. I sincerely believe that this was the Greek plan all along never to repay this debt. All of the theatrics and histrionics are for their own entertainment.  The PM will not resign, he is truly enjoying all the attention lavish upon him. It is also troubling to see all the comments against the lenders. It goes to show how the lack of personal responsibility and integrity has gone down to the individual level in our society as well.",0.949
10,"Paul - it may have escaped your attention that the growth projections underlying any IMF program assume that it is fully implemented. But the first Greek bailout, on which your chart is based, went off track within months of its approval in My 2010, with subsequent loss of confidence, deposit withdrawals, a credit crunch, political uncertainty, culminating in Grexit fears in mid-2012 when SYRIZA appeared likely to win the elections. Needless to say the growth-oriented structural reforms were never implemented. Blaming the Fund for all of the above ignores the elephant in the room and criticism in bad faith from someone who should know better. And, frankly, do you really believe that an adjustment program based ENTIRELY on new taxes, as proposed by Syriza, would promote growth?? Not even the Obama administration believes this.",0.9481
11,"Washington DC must take responsibility for the egregious government interference on the federal level that has resulted in the economic demise of a local economy. Suppression at its greatest, with a GDP that would make Puerto Rico #36 of 51 States (the economic size of Nebraska or Luxemburg) how as a American advocating freedom of liberty, life and the pursuit of happiness can we have allowed US Congress to have so much control and create an oppressive economic system over an autonomous State of the Union?<br/>Advocating Independence is not the Answer. the people of Puerto Rico have voted for statehood, give the island the same rights as experienced by other States in the Union.

14,"Yes, and they haven't gotten over it. That's why Pope John Paul II finally apologized for the sack of Constantinople in 2001 on his visit to Greece (<a href=""http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/05/news/mn-59656)"" title=""http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/05/news/mn-59656)"" target=""_blank"">http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/05/news/mn-59656)</a>. That event led to the Turks conquest of the Greeks and indeed of all of southeast Europe. The great mass of Greeks eventually made their way back to the Greece of ancient times, but not in a good way. What has happened since it, well, history, including at least 9 sovereign debt defaults with the 10th coming our way. History has a long, long arm indeed.<br/><br/>I was reminded of this a few years ago when I was in Istanbul during a basketball world championship. I was walking through the lobby of my hotel during the game between Turkey and Greece. A group of Turks were sitting there watching the game with an incredible intensity. It was easy to see that it was much more than a game for these people and it is easy to imagine that people in Greece were watching the same game with the same level of intensity.",0.9192
15,"Economic growth, of course, necessarily entails the growth of debt.<br/><br/>Alas, when the consumer is tapped out, and when ""the economy"" is so fetishized that the bare idea of people having some savings, rather than a panoply of credit cards, is actually seen as a bad thing.<br/><br/>It isn't, of course, but neo-Keynesian thinking has surely sacrificed the individual to the state, and the state to the economy.<br/><br/>But first principles, alright?<br/><br/>The US government can not print its own money because it must borrow Federal Reserve Notes as a loan at interest from a cartel of private banks. <br/><br/>{the FOMC is ""public"" for some purposes, but the regional banks and their ownership is indisputiably regarded as non-public.

18,"The Greek/German ten-year spread began to widen before 2007 so your assertion that debt and spending levels were tame cannot be supported by market intelligence at the time.  The first trickles of capital flight by the bond vigilantes beginning in 2005 was a sure sign that Greece was in trouble even back then.  I agree that uniform monetary policy across 19 different fiscal territories can feel like a straitjacket to those subject to capital flight and like wings to those who enjoy the concurrent capital rush.  I also agree that this was completely predictable.  The Eurozone designers must have known this too, but that didn't prevent them from laying down the currency scheme anyways, because the riches earned by the beneficiaries of such currency schemes accrue no matter how long the scheme persists.",0.9054
19,"Greece already had a hair cut, and Greece' loans from the other Eurozone members are already restructured. The term was stretched to 30 years, and the interest is super low. Repayments will start only in 6 years. Of course there are other loans to pay, e.g. from the IMF. However, in average, Greece pays lower interest rates than even Germany.<br/><br/>In the proposal of the Eurozone members, which was rejected by Syriza and now the Greece people, lenders where offering additional restructuing in case Greece succeeds with some reforms.<br/><br/>Some reforms are needed in my oppinion because there is no reason why the other 18 Eurozone members (and the IMF) should spend additional billions for a dysfunctional state.<br/><br/>Germany has already lend 90 bln euros, which is as much as if USA would have lend 350 bln Dollars. From Greece perspective, the loans are more or less equal to a whole year GDP, which compares to 17 trillion dollars if we would talk about USA.<br/><br/>The Marshal plan so many people here are refering to (into the direction of Germans), which I highly admire, is a joke compared to this. (I like to remind the people that Greece also benefited from the Marshal plan, as almost all western European countries. And Greece is, unlike the Marshal plan, not forced to by the lender's industry products.)<br/><br/>This is not austerity. What we ask for is that Greece manages to become a functional state.

Maybe people in these countries are selfish and myopic in supporting politicians who are asking for more spending cuts in Greece, or in wanting to get back the money they are owed---up to 4% of their GDP in some cases.

24,"Yes, it is easier to inflate a currency and reduce the exchange rate than it is to deflate government spending (and wages).  Furthermore, it is true the effect of deflation is a reduction of government revenue and a relative increase in external debt.<br/><br/>What is missing from this generality is that the Greeks, in order to have ""flexibility"" in inflating their currency would have to step outside the Euro and the EU (something about 3/4th of the Greeks don't want to do).  I predict that the result of Greece introducing a new currency will be hyperinflation, or at the minimum high inflation.<br/><br/>What Krugman is urging is high inflation plus bankrupting the country (making them an international credit pariah), instead of continuing the austerity program inside the Euro/EU (3/4ths of Greeks say they want to stay inside the Euro/EU).

The idea was that only under intense pressure could those ways be changed, even if some of the reforms would manifest as something looking like austerity.<br/>Of course Greece did what it does best, faking most of the reforms, carrying out only the easy ones that would hurt only the little people, while taking the additional money, again billions and billions.<br/>Nevertheless the Greek economy actually was improving -- until January, when Syriza came to power, which is clearly led by a bunch of complete sociopaths and habitual liars.<br/>Keynes' method only works if a country actually has a working economy and administration.

I wonder if any of the commentators would feel differently if it were their money going to Greece. <br/><br/>Yesterday I pointed out to an acquaintance that the European taxpayer had loaned the Greeks $250,000,000,000, thinking the amount might create a realization of just how generous they had been. Instead the person replied, ""by my calculations that's only $500 per inhabitant of the European Union."" So I guess for some people it's OK for the Greeks to steal $500 from every man, woman and child on the continent. <br/><br/>I personally find their lack of willingness to make the changes every reasonable person agrees they need to make - liberalizing their labor market, collecting taxes and not retiring in their 50's - offensive to the people that have been trying to help them.

Greece has defaulted on its loan payments and has already received an international bailout from the troika - the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Yet Greece's economic problems have still not been resolved because most of the bailout money Greece received was used to pay off international debt. That in my opinion was not a wise move. Instead of using the bailout money to help Greece's economy grow or recover the money was spent on appeasing foreign investors who could wait a little longer for their money. The bailout money should have been used to further Greece's economic income so that it can pay off its debt without compromising the livelihood of Greece's citizens.<br/>My grandfather was an investor and understood how to make money. He said that if you ever attained a large sum of money you should use it to make even more money. The easiest way to make money is to spend money, invest it in things that will grow in value over time. Houses, properties, and companies are all worth spending money on because you know that their value will increase over time. Instead of spending Greece's bailout money on paying off debt they should have invested it in the economy so that it will grow and have a bigger return.

I agree with you that small bad political decisions can be calamitous. But leveraged financial systems are also vulnerable to relatively small losses. The resentment and turmoil from  the rest of Europe having to absorb losses of multiple failed states may end up being a far more destructive force.",-0.9789
283,"So the finance minister who was in place when the problems morphed from bad to severe as the government he was part of followed the failed austerity model is heaping scorn upon the party which replaced his own.  Sorry, you and your pals failed big time.  You tanked the economy and the deficit worsened.  You have not a leg to stand upon in rejecting the approach of the new government.  This is just political sour grapes from a guy who can't admit that his approach failed.",-0.9802
284,"""Spiraling out of control"" is a conclusion without supportive argument.  Many data points other than the national debt would have to be considered to support this claim.  So, when all data are considered here, a very different conclusion is unavoidable.  We are not in any sort of death spiral.  We were hit by a terrible recession and as we began to turn the corner and pull out, we were slapped by the lurking realities of globalization, a huge factor that we had known about since well before Friedman told us that the world was flat, but had failed to make sufficient preparation for.  At that point, we were 20 years behind the curve, and this, not the national debt, is causing the big squeeze in our system.  As for debt, it is absolutely essential to growth and expansion.  We are being far more reckless by refusing to invest in transportation infrastructure (including lev rail system), genuine ground-up education reform, banking reform, and effective resolutions to income inequality and instability than we are with growing the national debt.  The Gopers to insist on paying down the debt by starving investment.  That's exactly (along with thieving oligarch) the foot on Greece's throat, and THAT will bring the nation to utter destruction.",-0.9827
285,"Germany seems to have forgotten the London Debt Agreement of 1953, and the Young Plan.<br/><br/>Under the Young Plan Germany would have paid off WWI War Reparations in 1988.<br/>The London Debt Agreement of 1953 dismissed 60% of Germany's debt. <br/><br/>It would appear that Germany does not regard the consequences of killing millions of human beings in a failed attempt to conquer the world as being as serious as Greece's fraudulent accounting. Germans do not seem to be embarrassed about their banks' due diligence.<br/><br/>Just as a footnote about debt and national memory; there is still a memory in France of ""German"" insistence on full payment of war reparations after the Franco-Prussian War (1870).",-0.9833
286,"Please explain to me how the debt and the deficit hurt us. Is public debt crowding out private borrowing? Are the ""bond vigilantes"" attacking our bonds as in Europe? Does it cost us a fortune to service our debt? Come on guys. Explain it.<br/><br/>The first two questions can easily be answered in the negative since interest rates are low Real interest rates are zero or negative (!). The cost of debt service is 0.8% of the GDP. I have heard for years about increasing interest rates, but it never happens, <br/><br/>From 1946 to 1973, the public debt went from 109% of GDP (it is about 70% today) to 24%. Did they do it by cutting taxes on the Rich? Marginal rates were at least 70% during this period. Did they cut spending? No, spending went up almost every year. The amount of the debt was almost twice as much in 1973 as in 1946. We never paid off the debt from WWII. In fact the US debt has been paid off only once in our history, in 1834, and that was followed by a terrible depression.<br/><br/>What they did do is grow the the GDP. They did this by investing in America. They did it by rapidly raising the wages of their workers, by holding CEO's compensation to 50 times their workers', not 500 times as it is today. And please don't tell me these CEO's were more enlightened because Europe was devastated. They took less because of a very high marginal rate.<br/><br/>I don't know how the discussion turned from jobs and growing the economy and to the large purple tuna fish of debt, but it's the wrong turn.",-0.9839
287,"But European leaders have made the crisis worse by their mismanagement. Now it’s incumbent on them to end the threat to the eurozone by saving a small, paralyzed country.<br/>---------------------------------------<br/>So, the crisis was of Greece's making but made worse by European leaders who rightly demanded that Greece be responsible and meet its debt obligations? <br/><br/>I suppose that the Eurozone has to forgive some of the debt owed by Greece but the latter's ability to borrow going forward is seriously hampered by its default. If it remained in Eurozone, it will not be able to meet its qualification requirements unless it is willing to reform its corrupt judiciary and civil service, redenominate its Euro-denominated contracts to 66% of its value or thereabouts, and change the retirement age to 65. <br/><br/>Same old Same old is not going to pull Greece or Eurozone with Greece out of the quagmire Greece has dragged itself and the zone into.<br/><br/>Tsipras has not been able to offer any plan - leave alone a viable one - for consideration by EU leaders in the meeting today. That level of irresponsibility on the part of prime minister of Greece is almost criminal.",-0.9869
288,"Thank you for this reminder of the heavy shackles that is student loan debt in America. A student who takes out loans and can't repay them will suffer all these consequences. They will be barely able to function in society where you need good credit to buy a car, buy or rent a house, and even get a job. Students will be shackled to this debt whether default is intentional or not, and with college cost exploding and wages dead in the water, default is inevitable. For as Senator Grassley once said in the context of healthcare debt, you can't squeeze blood from a turnip. Although if it is unintentional default perhaps the student might not suffer the hissing, vituperative condemnation of the NYT readership. (Assuming these are really comments of the NYT readership, who knows?) The comments show that American taxpayers have been well trained to yawn about tax breaks for big business losses, and to scream bloody murder about the investment failures of little people. Same thing in the housing bust when they blamed homebuyers, not banks. Maybe the next article in a series could be about the shackles of healthcare debt and the similar punishment meted out to those who cannot afford to pay their hospital and healthcare execs' mega-million salaries. Maybe a final article could be about how shackling all us little people with college debt and punishing and shaming us if we don't pay is making us better country than every other industrialized nation who does not.",-0.9905
289,"This whole thing is absolute insanity. Greece owes tens of billions of euros/dollars and repeatedly admits they can't hope to pay now or in the future. However they want to borrow even more money on the promise that they will try to pay back a portion of what is owed. The definition of stupidity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. The only thing that is going to help Greece long term is to discount her foreign owed debt unilaterally to say 10 cents on the dollar, exit the euro currency and return to the drachma so they can be competitive in exports and tourism. Next institute serious internal financial, social, and economic reforms such as raising and fully collecting taxes on the wealthy and business, and balancing the year to year annual government budgets by reasonable spending cuts, and raising retirement ages and cracking down on disability fraud. Then promptly repatriate the phony tens of thousands of economic refugees back where they belong and keep more from invading the peninsula. Otherwise this endless nightmare of poverty, unemployment, misery, and social unrest will continue indefinitely until some ""extremist regime"" takes over and takes measures most citizens won't like to cure the recurring crisis. The European Union is a prison house of nations oppressed and exploited by the big banks and big business. An evil empire without the deaths and torture of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. It is past time for it to be dismantled.",-0.9909
