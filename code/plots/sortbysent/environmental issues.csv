0,"b fagan:<br/><br/>Who's advocating unlimited growth and unlimited consumption?<br/>Human beings worldwide ARE reducing their birth rate, particularly those in developed societies (all of which exhibit a high per-capita energy use). <br/><br/>I certainly am not advocating unlimited growth, but efficient growth. To repeat: set + enforce minimum standards while fomenting best practices (e.g., for energy extraction, refinement, delivery and combustion). <br/><br/>Here's a corollary: avoid technologies which are patently inefficient:<br/>- high land use per unit energy provided<br/>- intermittent provision of energy / reliance on back-up sources<br/>- depend on continued, massive subsidies for their existence<br/>In case you weren't aware, this describes solar and wind power very well. <br/><br/>Based on your comments, it looks like we agree on a number of things. However, be forewarned that some in your camp do NOT favor ""[Gettting] everyone to modern living standards.""<br/><br/>Kurt in Switzerland",0.9835

4,"Dr. K,<br/><br/>I await your analysis.  I am pretty sure that I could reduce the electricity bill for all of the West Indies, using either solar, OTEC, compact thorium fueled nuclear reactors.

Eventually because of rising sea levels a lot of those islands will need barriers to protect the towns from water surges in extreme weather.  <br/><br/>I like the idea of manufacturing in the West Indies.  It would be a beautiful place to manufacture refrigeration and cryo equipment.  <br/><br/>New bridge technology is being developed that may make it feasible to more cheaply drive piles  and then 3-D print bridge spans in place (the Dutch) to extend a Maglev transport system from Miami to the continent.

5,"The bill the President signed to create the three new Wilderness areas in Central Idaho was the result of perseverance not only by Congressman Simpson and the threat of a national monument declaration on the area but also a lot of hard work by some conservation groups pointing out the serious problems the proposed national monument would have created by overlaying its boundaries on the already well protected Sawtooth National Recreation Area. The delays, controversy, confusion and distraction of resources this proposed overlay would have caused have often been ignored by national monument advocates, but are very real and caused much of the concern and resistance to a national monument among Idahoans.  By contrast, the Wilderness legislation affords an immediate, clear and predictable outcome, with better protection than any national monument declaration could provide.  This is probably the main reason so many people with diverse views supported this approach instead of a national monument.  The foregoing clearly suggests that when a national monument proposal is being seriously considered by any Administration careful planning and analysis must be given to any existing protections on the land under consideration, so any national monument declaration does not undermine those protections.  Such was not the case with the proposed Boulder White Clouds national monument, which is a key reason why the Wilderness designation was a much better and more supported solution. ",0.9678

15,"Mr. Brooks only got right that Pope Francis is one of the world's most inspiring figures. This Brooks encylical is the lowest of the low.  People and corporations who operate solely out of self interest are indeed inherently destructive.  The idea self interest can  be harnessed indicates a lack of understanding of how ruthless and powerful the self interested  can be at the expense of the environment, the American worker, democracy, the American dream, and quality of life.  Cap and trade allows wealthy to continue polluting for a price.  Folks who can light the water coming out of faucets near fracking sites have been compensated provided they shut up.<br/>Naomi Klein  argues capitalism is in direct conflict with an environment fit for human beings.  Poverty in the U.S. is increasing daily.   The wealth which might be used to clean the environment is jealously guarded by the self interested. We are at the point of impossiblity to ""clean up.""   The investment of this most wealthy of nations is pitiful when compared to the great need.<br/>Ms. Klein also argues the need to use industrialzation to lower the number of hours worked by Americans to have time to garden, cook, and lower carbon footprint.

16,"Walker's answer is incomplete because: (a) someone, likely with government funding, made sure there actually was a campsite; (b) the government made sure there was still a forest in which to have a campsite; © the government provided (or funded) a nice highway and sturdy bridges for him to get to his campsite; and (d) EPA regulations made sure the forest wasn't dead from acid rain or engulfed in smog and that the nearby lake wasn't full of dead fish.

17,"Thanks for your comment, Joe. You raise an important point. Would that it were so simple. However, I think the suggestion that sharing wealth and sharing water are equivalent is questionable. Water is part of an ecological system. As has been pointed out, conservation should come first, for all of us, because our manner of living is not sustainable. Simply moving water outside an ecological system without making certain that the receiving area has done what is necessary to sustain their own area is simply prolonging patterns that we must break in order to sustain ourselves long term. It is hard to believe that a town in Wisconsin, which is not a dry state, has done this. Also, as others have pointed out, the Great Lakes is not an infinite resource, and must be used wisely, long term. Even it can be ecologically damaged.",0.9199
18,"In the long run, humans will become optimal consumers of resources, taking exactly what they need, no more no less. We understand that because humans have done so before. The challenge is understanding why it must be done, how it will be done, and to make it part of or cultures. We are not there, yet, most of us. Our current cultures grew out of the way the world was experienced by Europeans at the start of the Renaissance times of the early modern times. At that time, the great forest lands still dominated Europe and man's use of the land made no impact upon it. As soon as man gave up cultivating or inhabiting a place, the forest grew back. Nature limited what man could do, then and the idea that man could alter it in any meaningful way was incredible. Those attitudes are infused in the culture of the west and have been reflected in everything we have done into the twentieth century. Meanwhile in America and in various places around the world, people kept ways of living that were mindful of the need to sustain what the land could provide and have done so for many generations. The American Indians arrived before the great extinctions of the great mammals, with their arrow and spear heads often found amongst their bones during excavations, and likely tipped those animals into extinction. It seems likely that their descendants learned about sustainability as the result. Modern man can learn, too.",0.9035

44,"Back in the 1950s my South Jersey town was nicknamed ""Peach City"" for its best-selling fruit. The highlight of the summer was the peach festival where they crowned a Peach Queen. But that's all disappeared because of California. It's cheaper to grow and transport peaches 3000 miles than it is to pick them locally. About five years ago we had a bumper crop of some of the biggest, juiciest peaches anyone could remember but farmers did the math and realized it would cost more to hire farmworkers to pick them than to let them rot on the tree. That fall most of the remaining local peach orchards were ripped out. <br/><br/>Is California agriculture really all that much cheaper? I'm not an economist but I can see how it would be more efficient to grow crops in a desert with water from hundreds of miles away, but only if you don't calculate true water costs, sustainability, or a host of externals like the highway systems. If the California drought continues, I think I may yet see the replanting of peach groves in South Jersey. And who, knows, maybe my 3 year old might be in the running for 2030 Peach Queen.",0.7042

Before the advent of the bT gene splice it was common to dust fields with massive amounts of pesticides to keep destructive insects at bay.

The introduction of bT has sharply curtailed the use of these types of broad spectrum pesticides while increasing yield. <br/><br/>Likewise, RoundUp is a non-persistent herbicide that *only* impacts an enzymatic pathway in plants. This has allowed farmers to sharply reduce the amount of tilling required to maintain their harvest. The less you till the soil the more carbon it holds on to (which is a good thing).

The consequences include changes in water flow (rivers, streams, and wetlands), loss of water quality, increasing damage to infrastructure (of roads, bridges, and canals) that is already under-funded, soil erosion, and the need to dig deeper and deeper wells, increasing conflict among farmers. Furthermore, over-pumping is also causing the structural collapse of the aquifer, permanently decreasing its capacity to hold water.<br/><br/>As if all this wasn’t enough, a recent paper, Uplift and seismicity driven by groundwater depletion in central California (Amos et al. 2014 Nature 509:483) suggests that groundwater extraction may affect earthquake risk, both in smaller faults close to the San Joaquin Valley as well as the San Andreas Fault.",-0.9441

Global warming is reaching levels that may never be correctable,, once the Arctic Ocean has no ice and is warming there will be no turning back the clock. Oil production has reached a peak,, ten years ago.  There is nearly not a single virgin or climax forest left on the planet.<br/><br/>We ARE solving some of the problems as they arise, but for how long?<br/><br/>If SARS had a slightly different incubation period, 1/3 of us would be dead already.  If Ebola were just a tiny bit quicker or slower, a tiny bit more virulent, we'd be in the midst of it everywhere.<br/><br/>We ARE realizing the horrors.  We only see our new norm.<br/><br/>3.5 billion was quite enough.  We had forests, we had fish, we had rivers and water.",-0.9666

Plus  millions of tons of artificial fertilizer, pesticides, herbicide, petrochemical, smelter, heavy metal waste  run off into bodies of water  that allow all kind of poisoning that ki of sea life from the size of tiny crabs to huge whales, shoals of dead fish and other creatures that wash up dead and beached.<br/>Then we have thousand of war and such conflict where  millions of tones of weapons of mass destruction including chemical and biological are used indiscriminately. Not to mention burning of thousands and thousands acres of forests including some that are thousands of year old. That carbon dioxide  created in the process  drops back on the earth  as acid rain, plus  acidity of oceans, lakes, rivers including microscopic  uncontrolled algae is real  definitely pollution that coke of animal and plant like in these  bodies of water.<br/>All in all  it can be summed up that mankind is indeed  creating an irreversible destruction  that in effect is resulting in radical  and extreme climate change as a result of atmospheric, soil, water infrastructure changes below and above ground including  the menace of junkyard in the sky. These collective  changes are indeed result in radical climate changes. Plus it is no coincidence that planet like Venus has around it sulfuric acid atmosphere. ",-0.9859
