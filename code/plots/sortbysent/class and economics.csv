0,"Government was key to producing the middle class in the US, and along with that came the wealth and prosperity necessary to fund a 'juicy target' of opportunity (aka, the wealth of the middle class).<br/><br/>This is not unique in history.   Virtually every previous civilization has crumbled due to greed and hubris.    Those that survived for any length of time at all did so by 'distributing the wealth'.........yet they too fell because slowly, but surely the wealthy class (or some neighboring wealthier class) accumulated power and used it to confiscate wealth.    Initially, in the more sophisticated societies, the confiscation was replaced with placebo's (like gladiator fights), but, in the end, the concentration of wealth always destroyed the civilization itself.<br/><br/>This may change when we switch to a more certain means of procreation (like invitrial correction of genetic deficiencies), but in the meanwhile, we're stuck with the age old method of happenstantial procreation that's subject to an enormous range of variables.    We need to take care that the more aggressively greedy and self serving among us can contribute and even succeed, but not dominate.  ",0.9854
1,"This article seems to assume that politicians should mobilize voter anger., therefore who to be angry at, the rich or the poor?<br/><br/>Anger, it seems to me, is very divisive.  And too much divisiveness is currently one reason congress no longer works.<br/><br/>If I were advising Hillary, I would suggest a movement related to unity.  And with regard to taxation, I would stress the idea that our Union is stronger when there is a proportional funding of taking care of our common heritage, our infrastructure, our safety in the widest sense of the term, meaning physical, social, emotional aspects of life.<br/><br/>Can Hillary do this, speak to this?  Of course she can.  And if she emulates Eleanor Roosevelt, she has a perfect role model, someone of great wealth, enormous moral authority, working tirelessly on behalf of the betterment of all Americans and expecting those with greater wealth and power to be especially generous of their time and resources.<br/><br/>Division (see Scott Walker/""divide and conquer"") is a harmful way to lead.  Anger is a harmful emotion for a leader to engender among citizens.  Look to compassion and shared responsibility instead.",0.9802
2,"The massive subsidies, that will grow, are a small part of the ""cost"" of ObamaCare we must consider when gauging whether it's been ""worth it"". If early on Mr. Obama had gone to Republican leaders and said things very differently, we'd be living in a very different, far better America today.<br/><br/>""Hey, guys, I want to do things and I need your help. I'm prepared to share glory and make you all look like heroes to your constituencies.<br/><br/>""We have an end-of-the-world banking problem we need to fix. Part of it needs to be stimulus, and I'll listen you every one of you about where it needs to go. Part of it needs to be re-regulation, but sensible stuff that doesn't kill jobs or stifle innovation and growth -- I need your counsel on this.<br/><br/>""We have a pressing environmental problem, and we need to do things here as well. Now, I understand about killing middle-class jobs and the need for a generational solution, not slam-dunks. What are your ideas?<br/><br/>""And we need to do something about accessibility by the poor to health insurance. Help Nancy, Harry and me craft something responsible that enough of you can vote for that we can claim a bipartisan solution.<br/><br/>""Everything else, we'll fight about. I'll win a few, you'll win a few. But let's all remember that America put us here to move forward ... can I offer you some good unblended scotch?""<br/><br/>But he didn't do that. Instead, we got a rammed ObamaCare, very little else and six years of deadly faction and hatred. Was it worth it? Decidedly not.",0.9777
3,"The rich want confidence that their position will not be threatened and that their relative wealth will grow. They accomplish this by promoting policies that will do exactly and only that.  They claim these policies will help the economy by boosting confidence.   But in fact many of the policies promote depression.  Some of the rich know exactly what they are doing and why, while others are fooled into promoting these policies.  Why is depression good for the rich?<br/><br/>Economic mobility is pretty high in a roaring economy, but for a rich person downward economic mobility is to be avoided at all costs. In a prolonged depression wealthy entrenched powers can consolidate their power and slowly build their wealth with little risk by buying assets at rock-bottom prices from failing firms and individuals.  Plus, deflation is a rich person's friend.  The risk of being eclipsed by an upstart is also reduced in a depressed economy.  So the rich greatly prefer depressed economies.  Overall it may lead to less wealth for them in the future, but the risk of losing their wealth or their high wealth-ranking is greatly reduced.  ",0.9775
4,"The USA became prosperous due to its ""Mixed Economy,"" defined as capitalism with strong regulation of business, and progressive taxation. That's a huge step from socialism, which, history shows again and again, from the USSR to Venezuela, is a disaster for nations that succumb to it.<br/><br/>There is no ""socialist man."" There are humans, who behave out of self-interest. Socialists' dreams of creating a new man always fail.<br/><br/>That said, the USA has sluffed off on the regulation part of mixed economy, to the detriment of everyone except the very wealthy. Unless we act to reverse this trend, in the long run the USA will become a place where a few rich need to have security protect them and their children from the masses of the hopeless.<br/><br/>Never forget that conservative policies (the Gold Standard, scant regulation) culminated in the Great Depression. Never forget that in the USA the era of high taxes and strong unions was also the era of the highest standard of living in world history between 1945 and 1980, and not coincidentally an era of great progress in civil rights.",0.9764
5,"The solutions as proposed by Mr.Georgescu to income inequality will not correct the problem but will in in fact enable the system to continue while at the same time taking away valuable tax dollars from other programs.   To fix income inequality the playing field needs to be leveled, which means that the rich need to pay their share in taxes and companies should not be given tax incentives to ship jobs overseas which helps keep wages low.",0.9591
6,"""There is no great clash of ideologies. Politics in the 21st century has largely lost its capacity to inspire, or if there is a gust of inspiration (as with early Barack Obama) it proves illusory."". In the United States there is a great clash of ideologies: Obama's lack of admiration and respect for the American political system and the mad hunger for power over "" We the People"" by LiberalProgressiveDemocrats.  It is a existential conflict, and the Socialist-leaning LPDs are winning with their central control of most of the America society and economy,  controlled: the financial, healthcare, retirement. energy industries; the ignoring of the Rule of Law, marijuana and Defense of Marriage Act, labor/unionization.

7,"If we ""import"" a lot of uneducated, low skill workers and their families, it stands to reason the number of low income people in society will increase. While many immigrants have the desire to work hard and get ahead, (insert Vietnam family that owns a restaurant or Pakistani family that owns a Dunkin' Donuts or motel), it is not true across the board. Increasing the number of people in poverty naturally results in an increase in income inequality. So, to reduce income inequality, let's confiscate the wealth of the rich. We could start with all those self satisfied Hollywood types, driving their Teslas and getting free publicity by showing up to support the current ""in"" cause. But, if we are going to have a Chinese style ""cultural revolution"", what would be better than bringing down all the bureaucrats? It would save a lot of money too..... Will we really lose anything if we take money and property from the rich of Manhattan, the Hamptons or Hyannisport?",0.9521
8,"Let me tell you what this means. We have had two SCOTUS decisions in the last two days - one for gays and one for the underclass (Gay Marriage and subsidization of medical services for the underemployed).  In the following days we will also see the Congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Pact (TPP enterprise among Americans and Pacific partners- with a socialist guarantee to American Workers that they will not lose income due to TTP. The hopelessness of efforts to establish Keynesian currency and trade parity between the US and Asian nations has transpired into another deal in which the multinationals and US international banks benefit, but owe the US workers they displace in the process. This means more struggle within Congress to subsidize Americans while the lose wages to policies that make the rich in America richer.<br/>Once you understand gross flaws in the System, you will make a lot more money by exploiting them instead of eliminating them.  The deals being agreed to internationally will make the rich richer - but they will demand that the profits of the rich be redistributed among those which the new policies make the poor poorer.<br/>Sequel to ""The Same Old Thing"" we can't stop doing.",0.9514
9,"I don't understand why Americans' reaction to one group benefiting when another group doesn't is usually to insist that nobody should benefit. You see this over and over: with the minimum wage, with health care, with student loan forgiveness, and so on. That's the argument that ends up helping nobody but those who are already at the top, which is probably why the GOP promotes it so assiduously. The smart reaction to inequality is not ""everyone else should have it as hard as I do!"" but ""everyone else should have it as good as they do!"" ",0.9484
10,"....okay - so let's hear it for equality!!  (1)  first tax the so-called rich as high as you can push (39% top federal rate, 9% state rate ad on city, property tax)  (2) we heard yesterday the Obama Administration's desire to deny federal money to communities that won't economically diversify, i.e. push depress the value of the rich people's housing stock (3) and  now force the 'rich' children to go to schools in poor neighborhoods (of course bussing worked well in Boston in the 1970's NOT!!) - sounds like a plan?!?<br/><br/>Ask the Commies - the peoples the former Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, Cuba - social engineering has a dismal track record. How about increasing opportunities for EVERYONE to get ahead - grow the economy, reduce regulations &amp; taxes - let America do what it does best = promote &amp; run BUSINESSES",0.9426
11,"If one could prove (and it should be easy enough) that providing adequate supports to poor people -- food, housing, health care, decent public schools -- actually encouraged people to stay married and exhibit other desirable social behaviors, would Republicans rally behind providing adequate supports?

12,"Neoliberal policies raise only the boats of the rich, everyone elses boats are sinking. All over European countries with the Euro, the rich are better off, the poor worse off and the middle class pays the price.

13,Conservatives like to talk about Ben Carson's rags to riches story and it is indeed admirable.  <br/><br/>It's interesting to see how many of those same people would never want someone like young Ben Carson (poor and black) in their kid's classroom.,0.9257
14,"The reason seriously bad ideas won't go away is because they aren't actually intended to solve the problems they are allegedly aimed at. What they really do is perpetuate power in the hands of those who use them for that purpose. What we are seeing here is classic authoritarian governance at work. Economics can't fully unravel it, but the psychology of authoritarian leaders and followers explains much.<br/><br/>For leaders, the high social dominance personalities described in the ground breaking work of Professor Bob Altimeter, it's all about maintaining their authority. As an electoral strategy it seems to have been very effective - they won after all. <br/><br/>They get power and give their followers what they want: strong leaders who can 'protect' them, scapegoats for their problems, and a simple narrative to explain a complex and frightening world. The leaders don't actually have to solve problems as long as their followers believe what they're being told - and they only believe what their leaders tell them. It's a bubble universe, and facts need not apply. <br/><br/>The failure of the press to burst this bubble is not hard to explain - follow the money. Remember the recent scandals about Rupert Murdoch's press empire, and how many politicians of all parties were in bed with it? Look at the right wing media machine in the U.S. and the role they play in catapulting the propaganda.<br/><br/>The reason bad ideas won't die is because they're very useful - for those who would rule us.

15,"Those oligarchs won't promote compromise.  Life to them is winner take all, I want all, and only the rich ""deserve"" the spoils.  Thus, the ""go big"" mentality that has polarized Wisconsin so much.

16,"The basic problem with this argument is the presumption that the ruling class of this nation wants to see poverty eliminated. Do those in power want to end poverty or do they want it to persist? Look at the legislative record that favors the wealthy being able to accumulate huge amounts of wealth and (if they can get rid of the Inheritance [Death] Tax) pass the wealth along from generation to generation thereby creating a royal class for America.<br/><br/>Americans have a track record of hating the poor and generally anyone that isn't one of us. We also have wealth worship and support a system that encourages the wealthiest to become the de-facto royals of our nation. <br/><br/>As I type this a handful of wealthy individuals are playing a game with who will be in elective office at almost every level in our government. They, like the royals of old, demand loyalty. <br/><br/>The poor? Who cares about the poor? In America, few actually do and they don't have the cash required to control the political system.

17,"Please keep 'em coming, NY Times.  We live in an unfortunate era in which one must be reasonably good-looking to even consider running for President (sorry, Mr. Lincoln).

18,"'...You cannot fix poverty by moving it to a nicer neighborhood; you need to eradicate its causes, not deny its effects...'<br/><br/>Fine.<br/><br/>The biggest cause of poverty for women and children is women having children before they have an education, a job, and are in a stable marriage.<br/><br/>Any suggestions are to how we 'eradicate' this cause, especially since we do the opposite, which is to pay poor women to have children, rewarding them with housing subsidies, welfare, food stamps, and medical care?<br/><br/>Since 50% of women choose to be single mothers, the vast majority without the means to support even themselves, it appears that all of our attempts to help the poor have only created more poor.",0.8919

21,Cheaters gonna cheat. There's too much tinkering with these complicated solutions and too much opportunity for end-runs around any safeguards you can build into these complicated systems that people think might help. Why not go with the simple and clean solution of the Financial Transaction Tax also known as the Tobin Tax? Our sunk bureaucratic costs are immense and still don't stop thieving banks and money launderers.

22,"Trump might be wealthy on paper, but it is the current tax structure, by which he is able to keep capital and translate it into wealth, courtesy of the labor classes who subsidize him in the process, that permit him to maintain wealth.<br/><br/>As such, unless he's been living off the grid, he's lying when he claims to have built his own wealth.

25,"Another factor to consider is the rise of the concept of a meritocracy, an issue which has been written about extensively by social scientists. Since the 1960s and the expansion of access to education, the narrative now runs that, if you have not made something spectacular of your life, it's because you didn't work hard enough. Our society subscribes now to the idea that the best rise to the top and if you try hard enough you can be anything you want.<br/><br/>The flipside of that of course is that those who are at the top, the 1%, somehow deserve to be there. Even though much of the 1% wealth is inherited rather than made, social norms still push the idea that the 99% just need to work harder and they'll get there too. So the impetus for the poorest to rebel is weak. The richest can simply turn around, Donald Trump style, and say 'work harder and you can be like me too. If you're poor, it's your own fault'.",0.7901
26,"Perhaps the first thing we should do, then, is to beg forgiveness for creating a society where some children are born to wealthy parents that can afford quality education and childhood experiences, and others are born hungry, are hardly educated, and have much poorer chances of becoming successful, productive members of society.

Later, dismantling the 1930s banking reforms led directly to the financial crisis of 2008.<br/><br/>And Medicare came about as a response to the problem of the elderly not being able to afford healthcare and later Obamacare came about due to the inability of private insurance to offer everyone health coverage at reasonable rates.
