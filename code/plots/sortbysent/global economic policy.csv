0,"It's said that the love of money is the root of all evil.  Perhaps not all evil.  But regarding trade agreements and multinational corporations it's clear that money rules. Not worker's rights; not human rights; not jobs; not fairness; not a living wage; not our health; not the environment. Therefore, until those Scrooge-like corporate lovers of money--and blinded by it--become enlightened and aware that ideally we are all in this together to help and uplift one another (we sadly won't hold our collective breath) it's best we stay clear of such trade agreements and instead mind our own p's and q's, do our best to be an upright model to the rest of the world, and finally take care of the many needs of our own while at the same time honoring and playing fair regarding globalization and trade.",0.9931
1,"TRICKLE DOWN  After 35 years, we can see the devastation wrought by the Big Lie that is Trickle Down prosperity.  Then 1% own more than 90% of the value of the country; 99% of new profits go to the 1%  That looks much more like a Pump Up economy to me.  When the 99% increase the value of their holdings, it's called a ""transfer of wealth,"" or given the snide epithet of a ""social experiment.""  When the 99% increase their holdings it's called the success of free market capitalism.  To me both scenarios look like transfer of wealth.  Likewise for the big lie that the free market is the most successful model.  If that's an accurate claim, then why is it that the highest rates of growth recently have been in Europe, where all the economies are managed by the governments?  I'm still waiting for an answer to that question and I expect to be waiting a good long time.  Because it's a fact that some efficient management of economies is essential to growth.  Here in the US we're shooting ourselves in the foot by eliminating basic Research and Development and heavy investment in the educational infrastructure, starting in the prenatal period and continuing as life-long learning.",0.9909
2,"On August 11 the IMF stated that the new pricing regime is “a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role in determining the exchange rate”. However, the IMF has also said that the “exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice”. The question is now: <br/><br/>Why should China let market forces have a greater role in determining the exchange rate?  <br/><br/>Teaching economics for undergraduate students at Stockholm University has made me realize the importance of providing students with an empirical background to current events. As a consequence, I’ve written an article on the topic rebalancing of China’s economy which can be found on the following website: <a href=""http://www.financialcrisismonitor.com"" title=""www.financialcrisismonitor.com"" target=""_blank"">www.financialcrisismonitor.com</a> <br/><br/>The article describes why rebalancing China’s economy away from investment towards consumption is necessary, and why a market determined exchange rate is one of the key policies for rebalancing. The main purpose of the article is to be a complement to the current curriculum for university students in economics. It is my aspiration to write in a way that even people without any previous experience of reading economics literature should be able to appreciate the articles. In addition, contributions from experts on the Chinese economy such as Michael Pettis hopefully increase the quality of the article.<br/><br/>Finally, I hope that the article can be of interest for those who want to have a better understanding of China’s current economic situation.",0.981
3,"In Russia and China, the Russians and the Mandarins, respectively, make up the majority, which makes creating national solidarity easier. And both have benefited from a long history of a somewhat coherent totalitarian ideology. In fact, simply having a long history, in general, also benefits Russia and China. Their vision may not be our vision, but unlike Americans, the Russian and Chinese political class do not suffer from historical short-shortsightedness. Thus, each country is better poised to defend their current nation-state, at least in the short-term.<br/><br/>The Post-Modern West, on the other hand, can best be described by V. I. Lenin: "" The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.""",0.9797
4,"Globalization raised this dragon's head above the waters.    Corporate entities represent 'controlled bubbles of autocracy' that we've invented to harness the competitive spirit of our animal heritage and at the same time protect society itself against the predatory inclinations of the animal spirit housed within.       <br/><br/>Problems occur, and have always occurred, when corporate overreach allows the 'animal' to find a way  to exert more control over society as a whole.    This has always been a problem, but it was easier to contain when the corporate constraints were national rather than global. <br/><br/>Globalization has unleashed the Gorgon, and 'corporate nation states' can now exploit and leverage the 'uneven and otherwise diverse terrain' of global governance and even use it against public governance itself.     These huge economic entities, the size of small countries, are now the only true global citizens.    They can operate locally as democratic participants, autocratic rulers, and/or corrupt despots in accordance with the local rules and their chartered need to reduce costs, increase profits, and promote the interests of stakeholders at will.  <br/><br/>All Kings and Emperors throughout history have fought for deregulation, lower  taxes, and increased wealth for themselves and their courtier's at the expense of anyone and everyone outside of their circle.    This time will only be different if we find a way to get the Gorgon back into it's bubble.     ",0.9768

6,"This is good for the United States and for both US companies and workers. We have learned from NAFTA that free trade keeps our consumer prices lower than they would otherwise be; but that advantage comes at great cost to our workers and a good deal of cost to US producers. Cars that should be readily produceable in the US for US consumers are built in Mexico and Canada. We lose those jobs and companies have to spend far more capital duplicating every element of plants to build products.<br/>The same holds true for other products as well. Japan seldom lives by the trade deals it makes with the US. While they do lower tariffs, they then increase inspection barriers. Same with China altho they are not part of TPP.<br/>The communist government of Vietnam an expected party to TPP has NEVER shown itself to be trustworthy to it's South Vietnam citizens and should not be trusted here. Worker exploitation in S Asia is a constant occurrence and should not be rewarded as it would be under TPP.  In addition, this entire deal is totally indefensible because it has been done IN SECRET.

8,"I'm sorry, but a President and Cogresses first responsibility is to help Americans, not to raise the wages and living standards of the third world.  And the legion of clothing manufacturers, shoe manufacturers, furniture manufactures, small appliance manufacturers, telephone support personnel, etc. have NOT lost their jobs to automation but rather to cheap foreign labor.<br/><br/>Before this happened, shoes were manufactured in Maine, emplying people.  They were sold in shoe stores by local merchants who actally helped fit you (also jobs), not in large chains applying trans-pacific buying power and race to the bottom pricing.  They cost more relative to income than Asian shoes, but they also lasted longer, were better quality, and were not thrown away but instead repaired by shoe-repairers (more jobs).  Can anybody really say our standard of living is better because we can buy ill-fitting, shoddy, throw-away shoes rather than Keds, and Maine shoes that may be on their third rebuild but still look and feel fine?<br/><br/>ps. I was trained as an economist and have spent my life in business.  But to me the economic argument is pure bull-pucky.

9,"While I was studying International Economics in college I was constantly reminded of the miracles of ""free trade""; and indeed it looks pretty enough when you draw a simple graph to show how barriers to trade (tariffs, quotas etc.) raise prices while reducing available supplies of goods. I was told that free trade results in ""job diversion"" not job loss (they are ""diverted"" to other countries). Empirically, it seems that free trade only results in a global race to the bottom in which corporations are free to conduct their operations in nations with little to no labor/environmental protection while drawing the same revenues from domestic markets for increased profits. This does not make the United States more competitive. FTAs  only benefit large MNCs, many of which have boards of directors that are not from the United States and do not care a lick about the economic downspiral they are forcing upon the 99%. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I believe that we have already sold ourselves out. The people have spoken; they would rather purchase cheap junk from WalMart than maintain a solid manufacturing base in this country. People want it all: jobs for everyone and cheap stuff on Black Friday. We enabled our economic competitors by making easy choices: we can buy flat screens from S.E. Asia/China, but can anyone tell me they have a skilled manufacturing job with a living wage in the USA? I don't see any jobs returning as long as people spend and vote against their own best interests.  ",0.96
10,"First, China's short-sighted industrial practices and policies richly deserve comments that are way more critical than snarky. They are a danger to Chinese people and to the world, when you consider such trends as China's all-out drive to build lots of nuclear power plants. Second, your comparison of China with the present-day United States is not apt. It's more correct, and more enlightening, to compare China with the United States during the Industrial Revolution, when in the rush to industrialize -- and the rush of the industrializers to reap massive profits -- human safety and the environment were pretty much ignored. Despite the many abuses of safety and the environment that take place in the United States today, these are not in the same league with what is going on in China. ",0.9585

13,"It's wrong to blame NAFTA for the export of jobs to China; that export was ""made in the USA"" by Wall Street and U/S. companies which put profits about people -- their own employees -- and outsourced their jobs.  <br/><br/>For a couple of years -- now past, fortunately -- Mexico exported more jobs to China than the U.S. exported to Mexico.  NAFTA was good for the U.S. but the TPP is not about lowering tariff another barriers for trading goods among the TPP members but mostly about a new protectionism, protecting intellectual property, a big deal for Wall Street, Big Pharma and Hollywood.  <br/><br/>The fatal flaw with what is known about the TPP is what used to be called extra-territoriality, the ability of businesses, through foreign ""expert"" judges (called ""consular courts in 19th century China and Japan)  to override, national legislation, including ours with respect to the environment, health and consumer protections.  The stupid ruling by such judges against country of origin labeling for beef sold in the U.S. gave Democrats a glimpse of the future under TPP and solidified opposition to the TPP.<br/><br/>Probably, the TPP can be rescued, by opening ir up to public scrutiny and finding a way to restrict extraterritoriality, which does not benefit developing nations, such as Vietnam, where better medical care will not be obtained by protecting Big Pharma's huge profits by extending drug patents.

14,"This is a great and noble cause you are pursuing. Kudos to you, Mr. Langone and others who are recognizing this situation and taking action. Finally! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I fear it could be too little too late. Capitalism may well be over. Scarcity economics based on availability of materials, which is the underlying basis for capitalism, is no long the primary driver of value creation in our economy. Companies like General Motors and Ford that employ hundreds of thousands of workers no longer enjoy their status among the highest value companies in terms of market capitalization or profitability. <br/><br/>Tech companies a fraction of their size in revenue and employees are in some cases surpassing these older industrial-era giants in market capitalization and revenue per employee. <br/><br/>An economy built on atoms is radically different than one built on electrons. In the former, new products and services can take months or years to create, with great investments in R&amp;D and production, and ongoing significant costs to produce salable items in volume. In the latter, new products and services can be developed by anyone, with little initial investment and low risk. A larger financial input may be needed to get to production scale, but then incremental units are produced for free (the first copy of Windows Word costs a lot; the next million copies are free). <br/><br/>It's time to start thinking about how the fundamental drivers of our economy are changing, and preparing for the resulting shift.

15,"Sane EU citizens in general share Germany's distrust of inflation. Especially in countries like Sweden and Finland where there have been state-run currency devaluations the last 40 years. There are points of views like this: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-17/sweden-laments-crazy-devaluations-amid-krona-strength"" title=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-17/sweden-laments-crazy-devaluations-amid-krona-strength"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-03-17/sweden-laments-crazy-d...</a><br/><br/>.. but mostly it's a gut feeling.

Whether or not economists overseas you never met and never will meet regard you as ""achieving a rapid gain in competitiveness"" .. :)<br/><br/>Yes, the internal devaluation will occur, it may be painful, but nobody is prepared to have their currency deflated. The eurozone is felt to be big enough now, there is so much trade going on that having a single currency in this giant economic area really is worth the cost. This is not only the politician's feeling, it's also in the voters. Likely also in Greek voters. You should be so lucky in the US, but of course if households don't ever save anything where's the incentive for low inflation.

17,"I am a big fan of Lester Thurow, I do remember his book and his testimony on his findings. <br/><br/>I am not ready to say that ""International competition is a mostly bogus notion.""  To me, US economic growth is slower than it has to be and our consumer market and distribution system is being used by Europe, Japan, and China to improve their economies and the fortunes of our 1% and we are leaving our population behind.  Trust me I know all the demographics but we have left too much of our potential on the table and given our market and the global market to others. It's obvious. <br/><br/>Foreign enterprises know how to use their money to lobby Congress &amp; use their money to shut out American innovation.  Nowhere is it more evident than in the story of the inventors of superconducting Maglev, Drs.

20,"""While I am not panicking about my 401k I am concerned that there isn't a safer way for seniors to invest their money.""<br/><br/>There is a cheaper, do-it-yourself way to invest in the stock market, but it shuts out the financial professionals whose livelihoods depend on management fees. You just open a brokerage account and, in your account, buy an etf that passively moves along with the market. ""Passive"" means there is no active management that would charge periodic management fees which reduce your profits over the long term. Defined-contribution retirement plans, 401(k) and 403(b), charge fees to manage workers' retirement plans and they invest in actively managed mutual funds which also charge management fees, so the worker is hit with management fees from at least two different sources. That doesn't happen with DIY exchange-traded funds, such as SPY, which is reported to be the most popular etf.

It is rumored that the TPP would set up 3 man tribunals to settle these cases without the protection of courts.

It is absolutely crucial for the US to get the Dept of Justice involved to prevent these health insurance mergers from going through.<br/><br/>The US has several recent examples where the consolidation of an industry e.g. the airlines mergers have harmed individual consumers.  There is no doubt that individual consumers will be harmed should these proposed health insurance mergers go through.  No value will be created for the consumer with these mergers.<br/><br/>Let these health insurers compete on the basis of price.

196,"Sadly ... every point made here is correct, and yet it misses the point.<br/><br/>The US housing market has been rigged to encourage Americans to sink money into expensive houses, and then is jury-rigged now after the market correction to try to keep prices high, rather than letting them go to a market equilibrium.<br/><br/>The mortgage tax write-off, subsidized 30 yr mortages ""pull"" people toward more house; most zoning laws discourage small homes or less expensive ones ... fundamentally because political jurisdictions want maximum tax base.<br/><br/>Most houses have never really been ""investments"" -- if by that one means something which actually makes money somehow: a productive investment.  Instead they are like buying gold or diamonds -- an asset speculation.<br/><br/>The idea that ""houses will always go up"" is clearly nuts, particularly as the US simultaneously experiences declining population growth and outright decline of real earnings for more than 90% of the population.<br/><br/>A house is an illiquid investment -- transaction costs of buying and selling are very high -- home value is tied to local economic circumstances, with wide fluctuations in ""investment performance.""<br/><br/>It was always wrong to tell people that a home should be their primary investment ... let alone their sole investment.  The government subsidies for homes and mortgages have just fed poor resource allocation and speculation.<br/><br/>No one should be the least surprised to see this collapse; the surprise was how long a run it had.",-0.777

They are inextricably linked. Mr. Bao maybe bitter that he and his patron were scapegoated, but blaming Deng and Mao is like Americans blaming the founding fathers for legacies of Civil War.

201,"This explains that the dollars provided by quantitative easing went in significant part to speculation overseas instead of economic activity at home. That means:<br/><br/>1) In significant part it failed it purpose. It was diverted. <br/><br/>2) It distorted those overseas markets, which will now un-distort and so suffer the damage of adjustments as the US dials back.<br/><br/>To me, this means our stimulus was hijacked. Instead of benefiting the US, it benefited a few rich people. Instead of building the US, it made our potential markets vulnerable, and so actually damaged the US.<br/><br/>This was corrupt. Insiders distorted the stimulus for private gain, to the detriment of the US then for lack of proper stimulus, and now for the consequences of damage overseas.<br/><br/>Corruption always comes back to bite. This has been corruption, insider dealing, not what it was ""supposed to be"" according to what the public was told about it.<br/><br/>I've no doubt many in government tried to direct it well, but this tells us the insiders got to it, and lined their own pockets.

204,"This is comparable to the problems in Sri Lanka--formerly Ceylon--when the British brought in South Indian Tamils as indentured labor in a majority Buddhist Sinhalese country that did not want them after independence.<br/><br/>These problems are everywhere the Western nations drew borders based on their own political machinations, or needed workers for their plantations.<br/><br/>But as I learned myself, living in and eventually founding a women's vocational and educational center in a largely impoverished Muslim country--only local people themselves can solve these problems, and only from the ground up.  And they can solve them, if investment is made in the right places and to the right people.  Poor women will reject unwanted marriages if they have economic leverage, and that leverage is easier to provide than you might think.  Teaching a woman to sew enables her to earn money without leaving her home.  Enabling women to form small cooperatives so they can assist each other in purchasing supplies so they can begin marketing their skill gets the ball rolling.<br/><br/>But big international efforts only feed the corrupt local officials who skim their percentage off the top and then keep on skimming.<br/><br/>I believe there is more to this particular story than the reporters have told us, or have been able to ascertain.

In China, bubble burst of the stock market may trigger the bubble burst of housing boom in major cities because housing bubble has been nearly peaking in China.

211,You are far too rational to reach average Americans. They are horribly wrong to blame previous trade bills for the demise of the United States manufacturing economy.

212,"Looking at the actual experience it's clear that financial deregulation led directly to explosive growth of the financial sector in the 1980s and beyond and the first sign of a Minsky moment was not the 2008 financial crisis but the late 1980s S&amp;L crisis which is often forgotten today.  That crisis grew out of the deregulation of the S&amp;L industry in the early 1980s and like the 2008 crisis it also involved a great deal of rent seeking behavior as well as fraud.  It also involved real estate and required large federal bailout and yet was seen as an isolated incident.  Once thing about the the S&amp;L crisis is that several executives were actually convicted and sentenced to jail terms including Charles Keating. <br/><br/>Economists have also forgotten that the S&amp;L crisis marked the regime change Krugman has mentioned in which monetary policy lost its effectiveness and the era of secular stagnation began.  Recall the ""jobless recovery"" from the 1990 recession.<br/><br/>The S&amp;L financial crisis was watershed event as nothing similar had occurred in the 60 years since the 1929 crash and Depression.  Yet, economists continued to support further financial deregulation and no one can be given more credit for this than Alan Greenspan who used the bully pulpit of Fed chairman to preach deregulation to the world.  Back then hardly anyone questioned Greenspan on the the wisdom of financial deregulation except for Paul Volcker who was not reappointed by Reagan largely because of his views on this issue.",-0.9935
