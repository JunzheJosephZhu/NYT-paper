1,"For many, this is an example of government overeach. But view it another way: for the last several years, battles over democracy, governance, and civil liberties have been fought at the level of local hamlets. The Koch brothers funded organization, Americans for Prosperity has contested a number of issues in a variety of local elections. These include using public money for charter school scholarships in Colorado, contesting a small levy in Columbus Ohio to improve the zoo and other examples easily found. Conservatives are using local authority with limited resources to gain traction for greater power.<br/><br/>Make no mistake: these efforts by conservatives are not to limit limit, but to push an agenda and acquire greater power. Local governments represent holes in democracy's sieve. Witness Alabama and Kentucky's struggle against issuing marriage license to intergender couples. This small Power movement is growing. It is and effective strategy, seldom noticed, but effective at eroding civil protections and stretching the limits of local authority.<br/><br/>The Justice Department push must be viewed against this backdrop. The locus of power struggles has moved to the states. <br/><br/>Should the Justice Department become involved? Should it ignore these small but important erosions of freedom? I don't know. But I do know too often we answer the questions before they have been properly framed. With both facts and context missing.",0.9826

I believe in our democratic-constitutional-republic as the best institute to date given the mandate to manage the commonwealth.

4,"Concerned Citizens,<br/>I think the wording of the First Amendment does not allow limitation of spending on speech because articulate national speech has always required mass spending.  With such limitations the traditional media like the NYT and Fox News could continue mass spending on speech including political speech (that's what they do) while other groups could not.<br/><br/>Some Senators apparently agree that the text of the 1st Amendment which includes<br/>""Congress shall make no law ...or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;"" does not allow limitations on mass speech.<br/><br/>It begins:<br/><br/>From <a href=""http://www.tomudall.senate.gov/files/documents/Legislation/UdallAmendmentCampaignFinance.pdf"" title=""http://www.tomudall.senate.gov/files/documents/Legislation/UdallAmendmentCampaignFinance.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tomudall.senate.gov/files/documents/Legislation/UdallAmendmen...</a><br/><br/>""To advance the fundamental principle of political equality for all, and to protect the integrity of the legislative and electoral processes, Congress shall have power to regulate the raising and spending of money and in-kind equivalents with respect to Federal elections, including through setting limits on—""<br/><br/>Speech includes one on one communications such as at the lunch table where the distribution of the speech is free, and other like television where the distribution of such speech is costly.  I can't afford a national television message and other can, and I am OK with that.  The alternative is opening the door to the government limiting speech about itself.

5,"""States from coast to coast are using public funds to help their medical schools recruit scientific stars from other states or to prevent their own stars from being lured away by lucrative offers...In New York, a consortium of all 16 medical schools is urging Gov.

6,"A. Conley:<br/><br/>We have a process for changing the constitution, and another for calling a new constitutional convention. Good luck with either one when so many Americans disagree with you.<br/><br/>And your excess on the subject of ""new countries"" is absurd. We pass laws every day that apply to all Americans equally, The laws against racial discrimination in voting registration and at the polls are enforced vigorously, as evidenced by cases open at both state and federal levels -- that the left wins their fair share of; and it remains that the South of 1964, still under Jim Crow, is about as different regarding voting rights of African Americans from that of the South today as it's possible to be. There was a time when Justice Dept. pre-approval of state voting legislation was necessary, due to the dreadful history there of suppression of votes by blacks. That's no longer the case and good riddance to the legitimate need for such a draconian measure.<br/><br/>African Americans today vote in great numbers in our South, and they are protected by a Civil Rights Act that is alive and well.",0.974
7,"The reason Kevin of Boston's comment below is so wise is that he captures what Akhil Amar and Jill Lepore fail to explain and perhaps even to understand. Magna Carta matters because the great jurist Sir Edward Coke resurrected it as a common-law legal precedent to fight the divine-right power grab of the Stuart Monarch's. I found fascinating this treatise on Darnel's case, the precursor to 1628's Petition of Right. Reading it is like watching Whiggish common-lawyers midwifing the rebirth of Magna Carta:<br/><br/><a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=A65BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=constitutional+law+viewed+in+relation+to+common+law+darnel"" title=""https://books.google.com/books?id=A65BAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=constitutional+law+viewed+in+relation+to+common+law+darnel"" target=""_blank"">https://books.google.com/books?id=A65BAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA158&amp;amp;lpg=PA15...</a>'s+case+charles+i&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A80-TMcVf7&amp;sig=8F2jnBAZMsA8zFRu1TVxGKOdXKg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI74HPmfSRxgIVQxOSCh0N9w2x#v=onepage&amp;q=constitutional%20law%20viewed%20in%20relation%20to%20common%20law%20darnel's%20case%20charles%20i&amp;f=false<br/><br/>The significance of Coke's work should not be understated, but that is exactly what Lepore and Amar are doing. As the brilliant Canadian historian Carolyn Harris has noted, Magna Carta had been cited by opponents of Edward I and Richard II on the way to deposing them ignominiously. Under Tudors, however, the Great Charter had become less than a historical footnote. Why? Perhaps because the Tudors were adept at parliamentary politics. This might explain why Shakespear skipped Holinshed's section on Runnymede when he wrote King John:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.magnacartacanada.ca/shakespeares-missing-magna-carta/"" title=""http://www.magnacartacanada.ca/shakespeares-missing-magna-carta/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.magnacartacanada.ca/shakespeares-missing-magna-carta/</a>",0.9621
8,"This week in the Times, I decided to expand my horizons and delve into new categories. I went to the business tab, since I know little about the subject, but amazingly I was drawn to an article which reaches far beyond just business. The article ""'The Right to Be Forgotten' Online Could Spread"" by Farhad Manjoo touched me more on a personal level. The article, which surrounds the Upper Court of England's decisions to allow search engines to eliminate results for personal user privacy reasons. This decisions concerns me, mostly because of its infringements upon basic rights. I believe this decision is acting upon peoples' right to access information, and also freedom of speech. One of the articles removed was a negative critique of a reality star. In my mind, this authors opinion should be allowed to simply erased. It seems to be a clear infringement upon the freedom of speech. The article also discusses how international entities are asking google for things to be removed not only from their local google, but the worldwide engine- which includes the U.S. This would obviously be a violation of the first amendment (right to freedom of speech). I can only hope that should this issue carry over to include the States, that the right to free speech would prevail. ",0.9615
9,"Scalia's dissent is disingenuous on many fronts, of course it's not spelled out in the constitution - in the 18th century we still pretended that such a thing as gay love or marriage didn't even exist!  Rights to the pursuit of happiness IS spelled out however, and now many people have access to their happy ending.  Democracy will survive, I am sure.  And civil rights, as well as marriage rights of minority groups should not be issues left up to voters.  The Civil Rights act would have never become law, just as the Equal Rights Amendment for women to this day STILL has not been passed.  ",0.945
10,"What I see is a fundamental flaw and deceit in the very nature of the STATE, which, collectively, creates the legal frame for both the national and international economy, consumer capitalism, some of the proceeds from which are used by governments to a greater or lesser extent to finance socialist ideals (free education, health care, social welfare, etc.), as well as classic state expenditure on ""national defense"".<br/><br/>We are taught, at school and university that the primary purpose of the state - certainly the democratic state - is to serve society at large, but this is not true. The primary purpose of the state, even the democratic state, is still what it always has been, which to facilitate society's self-exploitation, to the personal advantage of its ruling elites and favoured clients (who are invariably wealthy), at the expense of society at large and its long-term survival.<br/><br/>Why has this not been recognised by the academics we look to as authorities in understanding society the state and the economy? Because, like their medieval predecessors and counterparts, they are themselves privileged clients and employees of our ""patron state"", with a massive personal self-interest (subconscious more than conscious) in rationalising and defending its role, self-image (as our ""nation"") and ideologies (social, political, economic and racial, formerly religious), on which the state bases its claim to moral and knowledgeable authority.",0.9437
11,"This column rings a little hollow for not having dealt at all with the substance of the majority opinion in Obergefell; indeed Justice Kennedy is not mentioned.  Even the lay reader (I am one) of the Kennedy opinion is left wondering whether it would have been stronger had he grounded the ""unenumerated rights"" angle in more relevant precedents/arguments (and not just in the marriage/intimacy precedents).  I have not yet seen this issue taken up by a single legal journalist.  Mustn't there be some body of constitutional law helping the majority's case for the court defining enenumerated rights?  And if there is, how can Kennedy's omitting that body of law go uncommented upon by professional journalists?  As someone happy with the outcome of the decision, I can assure you many of us nonetheless found Kennedy's reasoning to be flimsy in areas, sometimes bordering on second-year theory-concentration grad student.

12,"What an historic day. What an historic week. The cover of ""states' rights"" has always been used to, in effect, make each state more autonomous, more like their own country. That concept is preposterous and more akin to sedition than anything else.<br/>A disturbing statement by a dissenter, Justice Scalia, is only more of the same from that man. He once called the First Amendment (and I paraphrase him here) ""highly overrated"" when he spoke at a Press Club luncheon in Cleveland a number of years ago.<br/>Let's enjoy this moment and later pick up the movement to continue respecting the rights of EVERYONE to live healthy, productive lives with love within the act of marriage if individuals should choose to do so.",0.9286

Not a single commenter providing a link to the magical web site and magical directions that will produce their birth certificate in three business days.<br/><br/>Try thinking of it this way: The IDs that are easy to get are the ones that are NOT on the list of required IDs for voting.

17,"LOL Muslims and American Indians figured out this problem long ago. Allow people to wear veils and beards and/or face paint. You can have all the laws you want and they will be ignored. Snowden demonstrated just how deeply the government has become an entity of itself, by itself and for itself.  If you trust the government or commerce (becoming increasingly the same thing) you are trusting entities that have no responsibility to anything but themselves. Spooks, 1%s their attitude has become, ""if it ain't illegal, its not immoral"".  And given they are all about writing the laws for themselves and giving themselves legal cover, even that isn't seen as a barrier to their actions.

19,"RESEARCH  So John Roberts used the Aztecs as exemplars of heterosexuality.  And protecting children.  While the South American indigenous peoples introduced us to such wonders as chocolate, coffee, vanilla, pepper and potatoes, they did not introduce us to perfected child-rearing practices.  Parents were ""permitted to physically punish their children and would beat them with maguey spines or force them to inhale chili smoke.""  I'd be amused with the sloppy scholarship of John Roberts who parses the historical record to suit his ends.  And the lazy scholarship of Scalia, who chooses only the meanings of words that support his beliefs.  But their deficient scholarship and reasoning are dangerous because of the power they hold over the lives of US citizens. Or Thomas's misuse of the word ""privacy,"" which in the 17th century referred to a toilet.  As Scalia wrote in his dissent, it is not for 9 unelected judges to legislate.  Given these examples, why should we trust them to define their terms with any intregity at all?  Who fact-checks the Supremes?  Nobody that I know of.  Since they play so fast and loose with basic terms, who will verify the facts of their statements about heterosexual versus homosexual marriage?  I always enjoy discovering when gods have clay feet.

21,"As migrations of peoples around the world continue to increase, the question becomes: how will this be controlled in the future?  Certainly, no one argues that the situation continues uncontrolled, that some of us live in our affluent and gated communities while others crowd into cities and slums.<br/><br/>The two ways are by requiring work permits and birth certificates.  No one can come into the country to work without a work permit first; no one can stay in the country with an anchor baby, but must return with the child to the country of origin (or be assisted in doing so, which would be a far greater savings to government budgets in the long run, for those who worry about the cost of bureaucracies and courts).<br/><br/>To do otherwise simply encourages the violation of our body of immigration law.  Once we enforce the law in an evenhanded manner, eliminating the incentive of those who would break it, the sooner the problem will be controlled and solved.  America doesn't need MORE people, we need people with skills and initiative who show respect for our traditions.<br/><br/>There is nothing racist about this.  You have either immigrated legally or illegally.

27,"This just shows you how justice often has little to do with what happens in courtrooms. It's obvious the appellate court decided it wanted to rule in favor of the city and then dreamed up grounds for doing so. Apparently because the city returned the ""body"", hollowed out with who knows how many internal organs missing, they complied with the common-law right.  Gee, what else could the city keep and still ""comply""?  Could they keep all organs?  Muscles? Bones?  Apparently these aren't part of a ""body.""<br/><br/>The appellate court demonstrates once again why the legal system is morally bankrupt.  From the Supreme Court rulings in the late 1800's that invalidated federal laws about hours and working conditions because manufacturing was not ""commerce"", to this ruling about what a body is, to the forthcoming decision in which a right-wing Supreme Court will invalidate Obamacare by taking 4 words out of context of the entire bill, the law is not what it plainly means.

39,"The problem with these kinds of calls for help is that the expectation is that the lawyers who will do the work are either the most inexperienced--who lack the actual skills to do a competent job without substantial supervision. Just because you've got a law degree and a licence doesn't mean that you actually know what you're doing. Very few new lawyers, even the ones from the most prestigious schools, have a clue about the actual practice of law until they have a few years of experience under their belt. It takes a certain degree of experience to know when to recommend to a client whether to take a case to trial or when to cut a deal. It also takes time to develop an understanding of family dynamics as well as training in tax issues to be able to explain to to a client why a certain estate planning option may or may not achieve a particular goal. <br/><br/>The other group that is burdened by these calls to actions are SmallLaw lawyers. For lawyers running a solo firm or one with two or three attorneys, it is often just not financially possible to take on more than one pro bono or low-bono case at a time.

231,"Texas tried to leave the United States in 1861. Four years later, on Palm Sunday, (April 9th) 1865 that ended. Is Texas one of those Southern states that never surrendered? Texas is known for it's death penalty which is a phenomena that occurs in former slave and particularly former Confederate states and disproportionately victimizes black and Hispanic people too poor to afford good lawyers.  Speaking of American wars, and as noted in one the other comments, TWO subsequent wars; Vietnam and Iraq can be laid at the feet of Texans- LBJ escalated Vietnam and W. Bush; Iraq's all his (with an assist from Cheney). So why would I vote for a Texas Governor. I didn't vote for George W. Bush in 2004, why would I vote for Rick Perry?",-0.9388
232,"As a litigation lawyer for more than 45 years with considerable experience litigating issues of destruction of potential evidence, your readers need to understand an arcane term of legal art:  SPOLIATION (not spoilation) of evidence.  In layman terms, spoliation occurs when the holder of potential evidence has a reasonable anticipation that a legal proceeding may ensue and that the material being disposed of, or destroyed, may potentially be relevant as evidence, or lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.  (I'm a grad of Harvard Law, 1967, still 100% active in litigation practice, and always have been a Brady supporter, deriving from that Boston experience, the greatest city in the country to be a student.)  Admittedly, this is an administrative, non-judicial forum, but the principle and standard should not be different in my view.  From reported timelines, Brady's actions meet what would be spoliation in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding in court. This is not immaterial or to be brushed aside because the forum is non-judicial (so far).  Brady knowingly permitted destruction of potential evidence.  As stated in Proverbs 28:1, 'The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.' (KJ version)",-0.9501
233,"Restriction of voting has been in the pipeline for years. Republican mills grind slowly but they grind surely--or so they hope. <br/><br/>After the defeat of Goldwater, the various parts of the GOP began to mesh. ""Think tanks"" were formed. Lawyers began to organize--they formed the Federalist Society, which became a major influence in SCOTUS nominations, and they got at least four of their members on the current SCOTUS. (Alito; Roberts, Scalia, Thomas). And of course, they got Tom Delay. <br/><br/>Delay, a Texan with a plan, saw state elections as keys to national success. State assemblies draw congressional boundaries. Delay was convicted on electioneering charges, but the election that gave him the state assembly he wanted. Boundaries were gerrymandered; Democrats lost seats. <br/><br/>Delay was convicted, but appealed  his conviction to a court run by a judge appointed by the gerrymandered assembly. Delay never served a day in prison. And his assembly blithely does the dirty work of political apparatchik's of the 19th century.",-0.9515
234,"Any identification document required by any state for the purpose of exercising one's right to vote should be proactively and without cost supplied by the state to the voter.  Any financial burden imposed on the voter should be considered an unconstitutional infringement upon the citizen's basic right to vote.  Any ideologically or politically calculated preference for one kind of document (say, a weapon's license) over another kind of document (say, a university ID document) also clearly runs counter to the constitutional norm of equal protection.  Any manipulation of established election patterns (early voting, Sunday-before-election voting, limitation on voting locations, relocation of balloting places, etc.) designed to favor one type of voter over another is likewise an offense against the constitution.<br/><br/>Texas officials know all of this.  But Texas Republicans as demonstrated by the Texas voting repression laws are committed to attacks on the voting rights of Texas citizens.  It is beneath contempt to defend this campaign of voter repression.",-0.9542
235,"I'll vote for Hillary if she's the Democratic nominee, but I admit I'm not a passionate supporter at this point.  I don't think this video reflects well on her - it shows her as a hardened politician not willing to question her own record or beliefs.  Moreover, she's wrong: Hearts DO change, and it's important to change them, ALONG WITH laws and policies.  Proof is the national about-face on the issue of same-sex marriage: when the polls said Americans were against it, we had the Defense of Marriage Act; when hearts changed, the Supreme Court went along.  A negative example is the Civil Rights Act, a powerful set of laws that did not change enough hearts: Republicans have been actively subverting their enforcement ever since.  Bill Clinton ""triangulated"" during his two terms, giving the Republicans a lot of what they wanted, including the harsh crime laws that have locked up way too many non-violent criminals, especially black ones.  If Hillary lobbied for those laws, then by her own logic she needs to express a certain amount of contrition, an indication that she regrets some of what was done by her husband, with her help.  She needs to admit that they were bad laws, as Bill Clinton has already done, and apologize.  But poking her finger into a questioner's chest, and belittling his views by saying she'll talk only to white people (a terrible thing to say) will not heal the breech between someone whose husband signed those laws, and those who are suffering because of them.",-0.9558
236,"I agree.  Yet the majority made clear- and you acknowledge - that the word ""State"" was unclear as to its referent, given the context of the whole statute, particularly the definition and function of health care exchanges.  It is basic statutory interpretation that, in such cases, a court must looks to the legislative history to determine legislative intent. <br/><br/> I agree with you that, despite the poor drafting, everyone knew what Congress had intended; nobody had suggested, before this case was brought, that subsidies would be available only in those states with state exchanges. So the real question is, not why the case was accepted- because it is arguably true that, once confronted with the issue, the Court could not assume what Congress meant without conducting an analysis- but why it was brought in the first place.<br/><br/>When are the Republicans going to give up on policies that kill people?  Repealing or neutering the AHA would result in the death of innocent people. Denying the causes of global climate change means increasing hardships for all. Refusing to subsidize food stamps, as Nancy Pelosi has said, takes food out of the mouths of starving children. Anti-worker policies leave us all scared and insecure. <br/><br/>Folks who are voting for these candidates must stop.Their theories have failed, many times over. Nixon was a liberal Democrat next to the current occupants of the clown car called the Republican Presidential campaign.<br/><br/>We voters end up with the government that we deserve.",-0.9822
237,"Call it the CT Supremes' Catch-22. <br/><br/>The Constitution mandates that the juries must have absolute discretion to consider mitigating factors but individualized decisions can't help but be arbitrary in that juries may weigh factors differently. Therefore the death penalty is unconstitutional. QED. <br/><br/>Brilliant. Why didn't this ever occur to the Founding Fathers?<br/><br/>Of course it's bad-faith hair-splitting and logic chopping designed to produce the outcome that the judges favor.  It is another case of our elite taking away our democratic choices because, frankly, we can't be trusted with them.  <br/><br/>Have you ever noticed that, according to Linda Greenhouse, the proper way of construing the Constitution is simply to ask ""what would Linda do.""<br/><br/>It is time for these tyrants to get the Rose Bird treatment. She was the Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court who was removed by voters by a margin of 67-33% because she overturned every death sentence that reached the court. <br/><br/>The voters did not remove another opponent of the death penalty, Justice Stanley Mosk. Later he explained: ""I probably don't like the death penalty any more than [Rose Bird] does. As a matter of fact, I think the death penalty is wrong, that a person has no right to kill, and the state has no right to kill. But the difference is that I took an oath to support the law as it is and not as I might prefer it to be, and therefore, I've written my share of opinions upholding capital judgments.""",-0.9949
