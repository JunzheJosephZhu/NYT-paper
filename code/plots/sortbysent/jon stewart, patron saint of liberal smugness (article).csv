0,"I never saw the Daily Show that often, which is to say I never saw it as much as I would have liked to see it.  Still, in this conservative's eyes, Jon Stewart was intelligent when intelligence was needed, satirical when satire was needed (of course, good satire often comes with great intelligence and wit), circumspect when being circumspect was needed, aggressive certainly, but also and surprisingly deferential and gracious when the moment called for such.  While driving here in the States yesterday I heard an NPR retrospective on Mr. Stewart.  In the balance, I would say he did provide something of a valuable public service.  Would that we all had the capacity and willingness to remove planks from our own eyes, whatever their origins may be.  I wish him all the best in whatever comes next for him.",0.988
1,"So Mr Egan is having a hate Trump fest and everyone is invited. Such vitriol, such venom, how easy it is to throw slingshots and arrows from the comfort and safety of behind a keyboard and screen. Don't we realize that we are bringing ourselves down to his level?<br/><br/>Oh, sure, perhaps he deserves some of what folks are saying, but he plays this game better than you. He has a big microphone, he has a media willing to perform lap dances for him, and he knows exactly what he is doing.<br/><br/>And then to compare Trump to a Catholic Pope, as though there was some relevance in doing so? Sorry Mr Egan, this is poor journalism, keep it up- maybe Rupert Murdoch will offer you something at one of his tabloids. The NYT is better than this.<br/><br/>If we want to confront Trump, and it seems like a good idea to do so, we should be confronting his policies and ideas, not the man. Let him be the one who stoops to vitriol and venom, rise above the bait, and don't become as he- we just encourage him otherwise.<br/><br/>Sorry go off sounding all parental on this, but I think we are missing a great opportunity offered us by Trump. Ask him the tough questions, challenge his views on immigration, the economy, trade or whatever- ignore his boorishness and drill down on what is important.<br/><br/>He makes himself available to the media, that is a good thing. He does (ultimately) provide answers to reasoned questions. This might just serve as a good template for other politicians, and they too might provide answers.<br/><br/>Just my 2c.",0.9833
2,"Wow, I wish you were my father; lucky kids. I love and adore mine and we have much in common but his recent ready embrace of hyperbolic Fox News spin (probably due to advancing age and fear of rapid change) breaks my heart, especially since I know in his heart he's a Nixonian Republican. Nixon would be decried a liberal in today's GOP. My dad generally approved of his polices, except for the ruthless dirty politics that was his ultimate downfall. <br/><br/>Jon Stewart has educated and galvanized this generation to be like Woodward and Bernstein, relentlessly poking, prodding, and exposing the underbelly of politics for the good of democracy. To do so is the essence of good old-style journalism and the heart of civic duty. By sending your kids to be a part of that rally, you did us all a favor by producing a few more good citizens and true patriots.",0.9816
3,"Today's column and comments are really interesting.  Paul Krugman tells us that the times are a changin', and that Democrats need to go further left and recapture the ideals that the party has embraced in the past--and given strength to America's middle class.  He cites Hillary Clinton's recent populist speech as a good example of this movement.<br/>However, a great majority of the commenters say that Dr.  Krugman needs to wake up and smell the coffee.  The initial moves of the party toward more liberal stances and the words in Hillary's speech are weak tea when compared to the real deal that Bernie Sanders has been speaking for years.  He's not there to cozy up to Wall St. or to woo his fellow Congressmen.  He has a very progressive agenda that's clear, sensible, succinct and available for anyone to see.  And he's a candidate for President of the United States.",0.975
4,"Dear Mr. Alexander<br/>When you have close to 1 million people each night trying to make sense of the world's news, smugness is not a word that comes to mind. And I know you feel that there is naïveté on the part o John Kerry, but like the song says ”give peace a chance”.<br/>The tactics of the conservative party is to paint any liberal idea as being weak minded and somehow un-American. Yes I do see John Stewart as my patron saint of liberalism.<br/> So pardon me as I read your opinion, and think yeah he’s my hero for the last 16 years, and has opened my eyes and put a smile on our ears for those of us in America who sometimes feel hopeless in the face of the NRA smugness sitting down and having a tea party while the rest of America goes through metal detectors to pick up our kids and a box of popcorn and wonder is this the next movie theater……………….<br/>Sincerely John Metz Clark",0.9743
5,"""Derp"" is a good word for something, but I think it implies a certain level of good-faith mistakenness that the Republican inflation warriors and Obamacare doomsayers lack.<br/><br/>I do not think the self-styled ""conservatives"" making these arguments believe even for a second in any truth to them.  They find the positions they advocate to be wholly self-serving to themselves and their clients (largely the 1/10th of 1%ers), and they want YOU, the listener, to believe them.  This is why they always adopt such an authoritative tone, and encourage their minions to drown out all other sources of information and opinion.<br/><br/>They maintain that these weighty matters are far too complex for your pedestrian brains to comprehend, so those authoritative sorts (who Krugman brilliantly calls the ""Very Serious People"") will tell you how things are in stentorian tones.  If it means that we if we Serious People must reluctantly take more of your money for ourselves and pay out less of ours for society, well, that's all for the best in ways beyond your perception.  Trust us.<br/><br/>I do, however, disagree that inequality is a trivial matter. When the few, the proud, the ultra-rich take too much of our nation's wealth for themselves, inadequate purchasing power remains in the population at large to sustain commercial and manufacturing growth.  I believe that this is the chief cause of the Great Depression, but the dichotomy is wider now even than it was then, and by a VERY wide margin.",0.9733
6,"Paula, with due respect, you miss my point: what is the point of the anti-chemical movement?  I understand that the chemical companies have a profit motive. My argument is not that chemicals are helpful (I'm not a scientist); it's that the organic movement, the anti-GMO movement and the anti-chemical movement largely ignores the other side of the coin: Chemicals, GMOs and food preservatives have contributed to more plentiful and cheaper food as well as safer and more effective consumer goods in certain instances.  I only urge an intellectually honest discussion. ",0.9565
7,"Brooks is on to something here; sort of.<br/><br/>His analysis of the core affliction of our politics is insightful. Read the sixth paragraph down a couple of times, especially the part about, “...those sorts of leaders have been replaced by highly polarizing, base-mobilizing politicians who hew to party orthodoxy, ignore the 38 percent of voters who identify as moderates and exacerbate partisanship and gridlock.”<br/><br/>Hillary is an obviously savvy but aging pitcher with a bum arm going into extra innings without the hope of relief. The degree that she is the certain nominee of the Democratic Party is in and of itself a statement of just how bush league the whole liberal apparatus has become.<br/><br/>The whole deal is after all a winner take all proposition and little about being fundamentally committed to and prepared to take the risk of standing firm for core beliefs and principles that represent a real chance of leading the nation out of our stifling political grid lock.",0.9545
8,Best teacher I had was called Madigan. I hope you're not one of his offspring. He was thoughtful and intelligent.,0.9136
9,"I'll try to remember to have more compassion for our Canadian neighbors than they had for us when we were saddled with an anti-intellectual reactionary of our own. Americans were harshly judged for electing George W Bush in 2000 even though more people voted for Al Gore. An election was stolen in the eyes of many, and yet Americans as a whole were seen as empty headed and malicious as our leader. It doesn't feel good, does it? It's a lesson in how perception and reality don't mesh as often as the media and our leaders tell us. <br/><br/>I'm reminded of the somewhat condescending ""Welcome Back America"" parties that were semi-common in Canada after the election of President Obama. Although the hope for better times was appreciated, it was irritating to imply that Americans with open minds, good ideas, and benevolent intent ever left. Keep all that in mind on election day. Don't settle for less than what you deserve in a leader, and don't let anyone tell you that the Liberal and Conservative parties are the same. ",0.9082
10,"The reason these Leftists want to shut down speech is the same reason that motivates all bullies.  On a deep level, they aware of their own weakness and bully others to compensate for it.  They cannot defend their positions and thus the feel a need to shut down the conversation.<br/><br/>Mr. Brooks you go too far in defending these petty tyrants.  You are wrong; in America we do tolerate Holocaust denial; we even let Nazis march in Skokie.  Not because most of us have any sympathy for such trash, but because we are confident that in an unregulated market place of ideas the truth will win out, and history has proven us right.  Holocaust deniers fail not because we refuse to tolerate them, but because of the weakness of their arguments.<br/><br/>You can tell who has confidence in the verity of their ideas and who is on the side of truth by their willingness to tolerate the expression of ideas they oppose.  And it obviously not leftist academics.",0.9058
11,"""Specifically, they believe that liberals are much more open to change than conservatives, more tolerant of differences, more motivated by the public good and, maybe most of all, smarter and better informed.""<br/>Your entire argument is negated by this absolute statement of fact.",0.9052
12,"Fanaticism of any stripe, wherever it shows up, frightens me. I don't like the mindless detachment of Americans, either, but it's more acceptable than the über-avidity of most people who devote their every waking moment to political causes. Convinced beyond all doubt of the correctness of their views, many of them find in their opponents either insufferable ignorance or wicked motives. ""How can you dispute this? Conspiracy!""<br/><br/>Tunnel-vision is what scares me about our lovely friends on the far Left. Read their media, and what you'll see is a dangerous certainty that the establishment, so-called, is fabulously wrong, led around by its nose by rich zillionaires and so forth. It's the inverted image of right-wing lunacy; and, like our Right, they're certain the popular media is fibbing. Unlike our Right, these aren't churchgoing enablers. These are people who will turn your teen into Merry Levov.<br/><br/>If one assumes the correctness of the stereotype, which is that Mr. and Mrs. Joe America are fat, ignorant, and sit in front of the tube too much, I say okay, but what came before was much worse, and what's likely to come after is anything but certain to be superior. So we must be careful. When people see that ""the system"" is producing outcomes averse to their preferences, they're too quick to denounce it entirely and call for revolution. When revolution inevitably leads to chaos, tyranny is justified in the name of order. There are worse outcomes than the triumph of Sunday lovers.",0.8915
13,A major example of how politics today are dominated by the conservative 1% club who have decided the vast amount of money they possess entitles them to dictate what is good for the states and the country.<br/><br/>In fact the conservative 1% are purely interested in enriching themselves at the expense of voice and freedom of the voting population across the US.,0.8777
14,"Liberals are generally the most intolerant people around. Nobody needs your ""tolerance"", Nancy, so you can keep your spitefulness to yourself. But if you initiate aggression, you should expect a response in kind. People in this country are free to wave any flag they wish without asking you or anyone else for permission.",0.8765
15,"Three ""wise men"" or three sleaze bags? They have abdicated their responsibilities as Justices of the Supreme Court in favour of roles as political hacks. Of the three, Scalia is the most dangerous as he has some standing, largely undeserved, as an ""intellectual."" His reversal of his federalist position in Bush v. Gore indicates that intellectualism can easily become shallow rationalization when political imperatives are in the fore, just what one would not expect from a justice of the highest court. The other two really aren't worth criticism. ",0.8676
16,"Thank you for stating something that is meaningful, intelligent, and not utterly redudant. Keep it up, please!",0.8553
17,"I cannot help but contrast D'Souza's confinement with that of the former intellectual guru of Canada's Conservatives Conrad Black. Even as a Conservative Black towered above D'Souza intellectually and morally.<br/>I am heartened to see Black's recent epiphany and his embrace of the democratic politics of Canada's Liberal and New Democratic Parties. I am awaiting an American moderate Republican to come forth and denounce the fascist tendencies of today's GOP and call for the return of democracy to America.<br/>The time of cowering in fear must come to an end, we must send the rats back to their nest and boldly face the future with resolve and planning. There is no place for the D;Souzas and Lowrys in the public sphere if America is to have a prosperous future.",0.845
18,"It struck me, while watching the video, that Hillary Clinton may come across as condescending because of the way she holds her head.  I have tri-focal lenses that cause me to tip my nose upwards when viewing something close up.  I wonder what kind of contacts she wears?<br/>I believe that she is in actuality the most caring, compassionate, yet practical &amp; intelligent candidate we have.",0.839

21,"When a political agency - such as any public transit system - attempts to earn cash by selling ads, it will always be subject to politics and political correctness.<br/><br/>The answer is not censorship.

Then as a free consumer, you can choose to patronize those vendors who don't display ads you want censored.",0.802
22,"Dear Associate Professor: If you're concerned about ""Condescension and self-righteousness with which liberals often treat conservatives"" how about also writing about condescension and self-righteousness that conservatives almost always treat Women, Blacks, Latinos, Immigrants, Gays, Union Members, Environmentalists, Non-Christians, and on and on and on and on.",0.7906

24,"Congratulations on a fabulous and perceptive column, Mr. Bruni. You absolutely captured the most important outcome of the night: how a truly ""fair and balanced"" Fox News hard news team destroyed years of attack and slander by Obama's countless propagandists. It makes you wonder what else Mr. Obama's acolytes have been trying to sell us.",0.7841
25,"Bernie Sanders can point to a number of his executive governing successes that benefited communities and society as a whole. This disturbs David Brooks who has been an advocate of the Republican party of ""No"" for so long that he views positive action and change as radical.",0.7798
26,"The article itself lacks a little coherence. Apparently once conservatives like Nixon and Reagan are office holders, they negotiate. Well, don't all politicians change their tone once in office? Jefferson's views on the national bank changed and with Obama we have no clue who are friends or enemies are in Syria from one day to another. Not surprisingly a candidate's fan base shifts and seems to change ideology once their hero is elected! Welcome to the pragmatics of the American political system and those who actually have to govern.<br/><br/>More importantly I feel it is implied in the article that the merits of an issue, in this case the Iran Nuclear deal, need not really be discussed. All you need to know is someone's political persuasion to know about an issue. Nonsense. Suppose, for the sake of argument, someone argues that signing the agreement now, will increase the oil glut, as promised by Iran. Shall we dismiss that view because the person is a right wing ideologue! A left winger! There are simply too many Ad Hominem arguments. I know it sells papers to say someone holds this and this position because he is right or left wing! But shouldn't the paper simply look at each argument for its merits rather than who said what?",0.7652
27,"Mr. Blow, honestly, I view the BLM movement much like the Occupy Wall Street movement a few years ago.  OWS had no end goals, they just raged against capitalism and large corporations.  In furthering their message, they used social media, FaceBook or Twitter on their...Apple iPhones.  If they took down these corporations, they would have no means to spread their message.  It was hypocrisy at its finest.  It was a completely directionless movement that just disrupted traffic and gained a fleeting moment of media coverage.  Now, with the BLM movement, it's the same, what is the end goal?  It's another decentralized directionless organization making a lot of noise with no clear realistic goals in sight. For every supporter they get, they gain a lot more detractors.",0.765

29,"The one thing that always troubled me about the Cramer exchange is that Stewart essentially asks Cramer to admit that people take him as more than entertainment and base their financial decisions on his advice.  This is a fair point, but Stewart has also been guilty of this.  When pressed, he has repeatedly said that he is just a comedian and should only be judged as one, but in reality, the Daily Show has been the source of news for some and the source of critical political analysis for many.  The fact that Stewart did this in a hilarious way doesn't change that reality that, as his show's popularity grew, it brought with it responsibilities beyond the comic.",0.7607

32,"The right to free speech by definition is being able to express yourself without restraint or censorship without backlash from the government [only].

35,"Americans have bought the conservative, individualistic narrative since Reagan so effectively sold it in the 1980's.  For example, both parties supported deregulation and free trade at the expense of the middle and lower classes, driving household debt up and creating the fragile system that collapsed in 2008.<br/><br/>It will take a new narrative to reverse this.  Bernie Sanders is the messenger; let's see if Hillary takes up the call as well.  To move the country back to the middle from the rightward shift of the past 30 years, we're all going to have to pull very hard towards the left.  Being a centrist will mean being a far lefty for the next couple of decades to reverse the damaging trends conservatism has wrought.",0.6755

39,"""The conventional approach is to blame the politicians and tacticians for this dreaded odium politicum. But we citizens need to look inward a little.""<br/><br/>A bit ripe a ""we"" coming from a practicing professional tactician (""The Road to Freedom: How to Win the Fight for Free Enterprise""), as marvelously illustrated, here, in his tactical evasion of the truly conventional phrase ""blame the politicians and pundits.""<br/><br/>It is also a bit convenient to conflate heated political rhetoric, which is older than the Republic and as American as apple pie, with genuine hate speech and the loci from which it emanates, which, in this country, given its history and current reality, are white racist and nativist. <br/><br/>But let us embrace his call for more temperate political speech at face value and welcome him to the fold...when he gets off his high moral horse, preaching to his fellow sinners equally for pretended equal sins, and addresses himself with specificity to other professional propagandists ""on his side,"" who can be named, rather than taking cheap shots at anonymous amateur ""trolls"" of all political stripes, who cannot. <br/><br/>By the way, I ""troll"" under my own name, which is a great inconvenience as the lack of deep pockets or deep-pocketed backers effectively precludes me from speaking out on a many issues of which I have first-hand experience.

41,"Krugman has been railing against right-wing economic ""derp"" for some time, both in this column and in his NYTimes blog. (He obviously added liberal derp here to demonstrate that he is fair-minded, but conservative derp has been the main target of his animus.)<br/><br/>Despite his heroic efforts to educate the public on this subject, the great mass of voters still believe that public debt is bad, and tax cuts the only responsible way forward. Many if not most voters still remain persuaded by the conservative myth of expansionary austerity. <br/><br/>Dr. K.'s efforts have failed to gain traction beyond the ranks of his loyal readers because he is vastly outgunned by the massive, well-oiled Republican propaganda machine. It is time for him to switch gears, and begin pushing Democratic politicians and political operatives to join him in this fight.<br/><br/>For years, most of these Democrats have allowed themselves to be intimidated by Republican propaganda. As a result, they have been paralyzed, like the proverbial deer caught in the headlights. <br/><br/>Further, they have not had the courage of their convictions to fight back, in fear of being tarred by one of the pejoratives the right loves to use, such as ""tax-and-spend liberal,"" or ""European socialist.""<br/><br/>It's time for Democrats – all – to talk more about investment – investment in infrastructure, education, research, renewable energy, and so, not only to make this country competitive once more, but also to get the economy off the dime and moving again.",0.587

That scares me: these people not only exaggerate and distort the truth, they believe they're telling the truth instead of expounding slanted opinion (though the article falls in this section of the Times).

In terms of both sides engaging in hot, cool and anonymous ""hate,"" as Mr. Brooks over-archingly calls all of it, I sincerely believe that the Republicans have the edge on this.  Even Republicans are shaking their heads at some of the extreme religious, social and political views already taken by some of these presidential candidates, many filled with hatred of one sort or another of people (let's start with our president) and cultures.

Similarly I can't think of many political comics on the right who have been successful.  (There are plenty of comedians who are conservative, but their main shtick is not political satire.)

One example that the authors give: liberals are more likely to reject mandatory school prayer whether it is Christian or Muslim. Conservatives are more likely to agree with MANDATORY Christian prayer in schools and are against mandatory Muslim prayer, even in Muslim countries like Turkey. So BOTH are biased. Forget about the fact that forcing students in public schools to recite Christian prayers is unfair and unconstitutional, especially when other religions are given a secondary status.<br/><br/>What Alexander is pushing for is a re-definition of the term 'biased' to mean in line with an ideological position (what the term 'politically correct' once meant). He does not mean bias against individuals, nor the failure to apply American law equally to individuals from different groups. <br/><br/>Being unbiased, for Alexander, means not treating Christians, Muslims, and atheists equally.

158,"The Donald is a prime example of what Hannah Arendt called, literally, ""thoughtless"" - a man whose comments and behavior exhibit ""an absence of (particularly social) thought,"" an inability to see anything from any perspective other than his own. His appeal speaks directly to how the Americans who support him think, to their own thoughtless thought processes, the rote parroting of derivative slogans, the inability to formulate or conceptualize a thought on their own. This is the looming endstate of the dismantling of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, the rise of 24/7 talk radio, social media that provide platforms for thoughtless commentators who demagogue every issue, and large aggregations of Americans who thus outsource their opinions to single streams of information. The Donald leads the current cluttered pack, but 75 percent of sentient Republicans still oppose him...but often for their own thoughtless reasons. The perversely curious will wonder where all this might go.",-0.8873
159,"When you are on the wrong side of an issue, saying something ""stupid"" is all that is left to you.  It seems so obvious looking back at the pro-slavery ilk that they only had stupid things to say or they would resort to violence.  And while it seems obvious to many of us today, recognizing the ""stupid"" among us, there is still a large segment of our voting public that enjoys the show as it reinforces their own moronic ideology.",-0.9001
160,"    Mr. Sanders should be covered like any other serious candidate. If any other candidate was having the kind of response that he is, his coverage would be front page daily. Instead we get columns of crap about people like Trump and position pieces on Clinton.<br/>    You use the label of ""socialist"" and then say everybody will run away like their hair is on fire. One can disagree with him but show me a policy of his that is not thoughtful and sensible? You latch on to the intellectually shallow and ignore the substantial, no different than Fox News. Sad that the NYTimes is part of the problem",-0.9086
161,"As a card carrying liberal near retirement age, I find myself bemused by the thin and at times myopic arguments against the TPP being offered up by my fellow progressives.  It's a laundry list of talking points - something I am endlessly critical of with my conservative pals.<br/><br/>The evaporation of blue-collar factory and manufacturing jobs over the last 20-30 years is a legitimate and serious topic.  But to suggest that NAFTA was the primary instigator, or that TPP will accelerate this, seems highly simplistic. <br/><br/>Would all these jobs have remained without NAFTA? Is the solution a high-tariff system?  Where is the analysis??<br/><br/>I fear that progressives have fallen into the trap of false equivalencies by conflating the evils of wealth inequality (which is real) with the imagined depredations the TPP.   If I want to hear that, I can just tune in to FOX.  ",-0.9092

(To their credit, they realize Bernie is unelectable or they would be backing him.)<br/><br/>Most of these threads skew (in the lefty liberal NYT!) AGAINST illegal immigration, so I believe they are now starting to censor and/or redact comments that do not support their left wing ideals of ""no borders"" and unlimited illegal immigration.<br/><br/>The truth is that they are not in touch with the average American voter, and don't know how furiously angry they are about illegal immigration, and the way BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT have pandered to illegals to get the Latino vote.",-0.9365

China is a fascist oligarchy which claims to be communist, like North Korea, the old U.S.S.R., Cuba, and other CINO's (commies in name only).  I don't believe communism can actually exist with human nature being what it is, but progressive liberalism actually holds democracy to be the ideal form of government available.  And progressive liberals in America are the ones fighting for environmental and workplace regulations to prevent this sort of disaster, while conservatives fight against it, so this disaster is far more emblematic of what would happen with extreme conservatives in charge.",-0.9522

How about ""pompous"" or ""pretentious""? <br/><br/>The only reason required to oppose the death penalty is that the State  has a history of convicting the wrong person, not just in the US but pretty well everywhere.

170,"This author is fairly ignorant of the reality of the 'liberal/conservative divide'--that the conservative movement is based on an irreversible ratcheting of outrage.  To acknowledge a conservative point, which I have done a thousand times, only results in a more extreme starting point and then the next ratcheting of the issue.  The gun crowd talks about the government taking away their right to bear arms, but the issue goes from automatic weapon ownership to carrying assault rifles in the grocery store.  The right of a woman to choose winds into the idea that a fertilized egg has property rights--which would ban all forms of birth control save for condoms and de-fertilization.  Global warming had reasonable questions in 1980, but has blown into full denial and is accompanied by the accusation that there is a global conspiracy amongst scientists in order to continue their funding.  Mr. Stewart, like all liberals, is faced with an opposition that is basically insane, so there is no equivalency in the argument.  He, and we, understand the mind of the conservative and after years of attempting some form of rationale we have simply drawn a line in the sand.  This isn't smugness, it is called making a stand.",-0.9744
171,"We Americans have so little contact with Iranians through social situations, or social media, that fear based on unfamiliarity rules the argument against this agreement from the right leaning amongst us.  That, and the constant beating of war drums on the all potent 'talk radio,' with religion of distrust and paranoia thrown in by the Republican extremists. The hate built up against President Obama reminds me of George Orwell's group hates against the target of the moment in 1984. If this deal is rejected because of the hate and paranoia of the right wingers, and we have another Iraq style war in Iran this time? Instigated by the same delusional ones who gave us Iraq; I don't know if our country would survive the results. An interesting PBS show by Rick Steves on world travel, put him in Iran, and when you heard show common it was for Iranians on the street, younger Iranians, to fluently speak English, and they all said they liked Americans, it makes you wonder what they would think after we started bombing them.
