I wish exercise was enough to keep the weight off because I am one of those rare people who absolutely loves to exercise (seriously there is nothing else that makes me feel better then exercise) but it is not, otherwise I would not be overweight. I love food, growing it, cooking it and eating it!",0.988

While searching the science section, I saw an article that discussed the importance of a new vaccine created to help in an epidemic. It was intriguing to me because I was curious about how the process of developing a vaccine worked. Last year, an experiment for a vaccine was tested on Ebola in Guinea. Luckily, the vaccine was successful and provided protection 10 days after the injection. The president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Dr. Peter J. Hotez, stated “We should have had an Ebola vaccine two or three years ago.” Ebola vaccines weren’t put in trials until the West African Outbreak last year. Shortly after the vaccine, the rate of the people with the disease decreased. Vaccines save thousands of lives. However, they are difficult to develop. Dr. Plotkin explained how designing experimental forms to test on plants and animals can cost $25 million dollars. Also, the researchers have to put the vaccine through many trials in humans. Dr Plotkin, Dr. Mahmoud, and Jerry Farrar issued a call for better ways to get vaccines through the pipeline quicker. In addition, they proposed the creation of a global vaccine-development fund. In conclusion, I learned a lot about vaccines and I have high hopes that researchers will continue to create more of them to help protect the world.",0.9851
2,"Many studies have shown that PT is JUST as, if not more effective than, many knee surgeries. Have you lost weight? Just 5 lbs can make a difference to your knees. What about your posture - that affects knee pain, too. As does the condition of your feet. E.g., pronation (from falling arches) will lead to knee pain that can be slowly but effectively solved with specific arch support (available online at reasonable prices). I solved 90% of my knee pain by losing 12 lbs, using gel toe separators to re-align my leg from the foot up, wearing Vionic shoes and arch supports, and walking daily to build muscle support for joints. When I still have pain, I use a $30 knee support with a magnet and that works quite well.<br/><br/>These solutions cost me less than $200. LOL. I will have the health care I want - not the overpriced drug and surgery focused health care that the ACA promotes.",0.9799
3,"The article that most captured my interest this week on the New York Times, was the Mexican Cavefish Obesity article. This is due to the fact that, not only does it speak of the fascinating discovery of these small fish that have developed the ability to eat everything they can manage to swallow, made by scientists in Mexico, but also that it draws attention to the genetic problems that lead to obesity, in this case the mutation in the melanocortin 4 gene seen in many obese people as well as the fish, and the possible solutions to this issue. This discovery, I believe, will prompt a solution to the ever-growing problem of obesity by means of extensive studies conducted to the Mexican cavefish, without much disturbance to their environment, I hope, and the detailed analysis of obese people's genetic makeup, which might give us the ability to reduce obesity by a substantial amount. To summarize, this discovery has amazing potential, if scientists are given the liberty to pursue it, the outcomes may be very benefiting to many.",0.978
4,"The bar for being acceptable as a treatment that physicians and other providers can offer, and have the blessing of the FDA and overall being paid for by CMS, is variable.<br/><br/>I can chop up alfalfa and stuff it in a capsule and sell it as a supplement with the magic phrase ""Not evaluated by FDA for effectiveness"" or some such rot, yet there were some useful items removed a few years ago becaues the FDA said prove they work or take them off the market.  As generics and with little funding otherwise to do the needed rigorous studies, no one did them.<br/><br/>I'm not so sure that genetic testing will be the magic bullet to allow us to say which person will respond to a less than always helpful drug or treatment or not, but it is well known that some people do well with a 'drug' or treatment and others act as if they'd taken water.<br/><br/>I agree we need to be able to offer the most likely treatment first off, then have others in the list to tell patients about, and try if they wish.<br/><br/>The big money waster in this country right now is the flood of TV and internet and display space in drug stores of products which really have an extremely marginal chance of doing anything except transferring the money from the user to the charlatan promoting it.  Colonic cleansing comes quickly to mind.<br/><br/>The billions wasted on those hopeful treatments should be diverted to good food, preventative care which includes exercise and avoidance of items such as tobacco which have no benefit to society or the individual",0.9705
5,"I had endometriosis as a teenager, as did one of my sisters.  I am now older and in menopause so it is no longer an issue.  Recently I found out that endo is an autoimmune disease, of which I have two others.  I have been on an autoimmune protocol diet for about a year now, after reading Sarah Ballantyne's ""The Paleo Approach:  Reverse Autoimmune Disease and Heal Your Body.""  I don't know if this diet would have controlled my endo, but I have fewer migraines, better concentration, better sleep patterns, and better moods on the diet.  For those looking for a dietary approach, I would definitely recommend reading this book.  Also, if a person has one autoimmune disease, the chances of having a second or third are much higher.  Few autoimmune diseases are diagnosed as such, and the numbers seem to be increasing with all the environmental triggers of modern society.  Women seem to be affected by autoimmune conditions to a greater extent than men.",0.9689
6,"Well, it's bit late in the comments game, but for what it's worth, my experience Mirrors Mr. Gameau's. When I eat sugar, my weight goes up and I'm hungry all the time. When I cut out sugar, my weight goes down to its ideal level and I'm not hungry all the time. (Not sure if refined carbs of other kinds have a similar effect since I tend to eat them/cut them out in sync but fructose is known to be uniquely fattening and it is important to note that added sugars can consist of processed natural foods like fruit juice -- you might as well be eating sodas with vitamin c.)",0.968
7,"I’m not surprised at the comments chastising this writer for staying in therapy for 45 years, or the ones chastising the therapist for being more of a friend than a therapist. The suggestions to try more “effective” remedies, such as drugs or CBT, are predictable as well. The fact is that some people are just wired differently, and they do what works for them and muddle through the best they can. Pills and CBT haven’t worked for me at all. What has helped me has been mostly talking to people with whom I have relationships, albeit non-professional, like my husband and friends. I’m still riddled with anxiety, but I am functional and happy and surrounded by wonderful people. There are worse things to do with your life than to engage in a lifelong, meaningful conversation with someone who cares about you. ",0.9674
8,"This is a great read, and Dan Buettner clearly has done a lot of interesting field research. As a nutrition professional, I am on board with a lot of his recommendations. However, to completely eschew certain classes of foods without taking into consideration their preparation is a bit off-base. For example: Cow's milk, when cultured into yogurt or kefir, can be an incredible source of nutrition and beneficial live bacteria that can drastically improve health and digestive function. To suggest that we should completely call off all forms of dairy and replace it with soy milk is not a longevity-boosting move for many people. Soy milk- especially the commercial kind sold everywhere that is full of preservatives like carageenan and xanthan gum- has not been traditionally fermented like tempeh/miso/soy sauce, which removes many of it's harmful properties like phytoestrogens and lectins. Unfermented soy can be particularly harmful for those with thyroid conditions, autoimmune disorders, and hormonal imbalances. I love a lot of this information but think that, like any nutrition advice, the claims need to be researched more thoroughly. ",0.96
9,"The article is lovely, but the comments are priceless. I've enjoyed reading them all. I'm 68 and waiting to have a hip implant within the next two days. I have been just fine till my hip and my back caused painful trouble making it difficult to manage simple things. I live alone and It surprised me how much I had relied on my body just being there, doing what I asked of it and suddenly it couldn't. <br/><br/>The next three months will be spent rehabilitating and my hope is that the sense of suddenly being 'old' will leave me as I (stationary) bike my way back to walking health. I have always been physically active, Aikido, tennis, long walks and so on, but now I note the fat spreading its way around my waist - no thanks. <br/><br/>I have become deaf, that was really quite unpleasant, but I have a Cochlear Implant (CI) which is a marvelous thing, I love being able to hear the blackbirds singing in my garden. I don't envision living till I am 90, but with the CI and the new hip, I should be alright even so. ",0.9436
10,"Fifteen years ago, when I was eighteen, I weighed in at 308 lbs. I was an active young man, with an extremely vigorous occupation. I was rarely without a soda in hand. In 2002 I made a commitment to clean up my diet, swearing of soda, among other things, cold turkey. Within 2 years I had lost 100 pounds. Today I average 170 pounds. Of course my campaign to lose weight involved increasing my exercise, but not to any uncomfortable or unreasonable degree. Without a drastic retooling of my diet, and a significant reduction in caloric intake, I would undoubtedly still be overweight.<br/>People do not recognize the level of exertion required to negate over-consumption. Many also fail to understand that soda is a major contributor to energy intake. Soda is not food, it does not satiate. It contains no nutritive qualities with the exception of energy from glucose. Soda sneaks into one's diet without saying much at all, it takes up little space at the party, it is an inconspicuous pile of calories that just hangs out and goes unnoticed--until we step on the scale.<br/>I attribute a tremendous portion of my success to the elimination--complete elimination--of soda from my diet. I've been fit and healthy for fifteen years, I haven't has so much as a sip of Coke for as long.<br/>Not to mention the savings in dental bills. ",0.9434
11,"YES! There are a number of published studies (in Pediatrics journal, etc) that have proven that Early Invention education for toddlers with Autism is highly effective, with significant improvement in IQ, speech, and social interactions, normalizing brain activity, and decreasing autistic symptoms.  The earlier the intervention (while the child's brain is still developing) the better the results in normal brain development.  That's why early screening is essential.",0.9369
12,"The last person I would turn to for nutritional advice is a physician, especially an academic who recommends aspartame for children. Doctors know how to treat disease but have minimal familiarity with true health. Better to rely on personal experience, common sense, and collective wisdom. Not all sources of water are equal, many drinks actually increase thirst rather than slaking it, and our diets are so artificial and unnatural that the body loses touch with its own natural barometric readings like hunger and thirst. Given that my body is approximately 60% water, I'm going to continue to keep it replenished. As one person wondered, have you ever heard of anyone suffering from overhydration? ",0.936
13,"Hi David,<br/>Neurodiversity in the sense of different ways of being, thinking, and interacting with the world is wonderful.<br/>Pain, serious heath problems, and decreased quality of life are issues that few people want to experience first hand.  So it makes sense to develop scientific knowledge of the aspects of autism biochemistry that are responsible for these.  In addition it would be of great value if such scientific knowledge can lead to therapies that can treat these issues in those affected.  To be clear if such therapies are developed and you are affected you should decide whether you want to use them.<br/>For me I am affected to some degree by the same biochemical dysfunction that effects many with autism and to the extent that low risk therapies are developed for this dysfunctional biochemistry I want access to them.  In addition my son is affected and to the extent therapies can be developed that could improve his quality of life and his well-being, I want him to have access to them as well.  That is why the research on autism biochemistry that Autism Speaks and other organizations like it fund is so important.",0.9321
14,"Research suggests that the health benefits of exercise likely have more to do with favorable changes in body composition, that is, lowering body fat especially visceral fat and increasing muscle mass.  Exercise also increases blood flow to the brain which probably explains improved memory and a lowering of the risk of dementia.<br/><br/>Research also suggests that fitness is not nearly as important to health as what it was once thought to be.  In fact, no study has ever shown that merely increasing VO2 max has any health benefits whatsoever.  Low intensity exercise (that tends not to increase fitness very much) has been shown to have nearly the same health benefits are high intensity exercise and this study is no exception.  Some people cannot improve their cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by a VO2 max test, no matter how much they exercise. And now we know that some people with incredibly high VO2 max readings like Lance Armstrong were doping all along. <br/><br/>Genetics is the main factor behind the large individual differences in the ability of exercise to improve fitness and someone's genetic inheritance cannot be changed. That's why setting a goal of merely increasing cardiorespiratory fitness is not going to work with many people who will soon give up and go back to being sedentary.<br/><br/> It's time to stop telling people they need to achieve a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness to gain the health benefits of exercise.

18,"Like most everything, the middle path probably has more truth than either extreme, and neither a pediatrician nor  the medical industry has any particular lock on the truth. I remember when Drs advertised smoking cigarettes, or said we get all the vitamins from the food we eat and don't benefit from supplements, or told us that eggs were a death sentence. <br/><br/>So let's calm down and acknowledge that many people don't drink enough water  (and you sure don't get water through drinking diuretics like coffee and tea - come on, Doc!). If your heels and elbows are dry and scaley, you probably could use a little more water. <br/><br/>And yes, it's probably true that most people don't need 8 glasses of water a day.

33,"The article that I found to be the most interesting this week was titled ""Congress and Obama Are Too Timid on Marijuana Reform"" by The Editorial Board.I found it to be the most interesting article this week because the topic has been talked about for a long time now. A lot of people strongly oppose the use of recreational marijuana because it is believed by some to be a gateway drug to substances such as cocaine, heroin, and crack. The use of recreational marijuana can also affect the ability to safely operate a motor vehicle, and people feel that it may be very unsafe to be on the roads with people that are high.<br/>But there are also a lot of reasons to legalize the use of recreational marijuana. Congress and Obama want to legalize it because they can regulate the way farmers grow the cannabis plants. This makes the end product much safer for the consumer than marijuana that you may buy from the guy you meet in a back alley at 3 in the morning. Although there is not a very large amount that you can purchase in Colorado, those sales are being taxed by the state. That tax money is money that the government would not have gotten had it not legalized recreational marijuana.<br/>In regards to this topic, I am pretty split.

56,"A pattern appears to emerge. The absence of essential microbiota might contribute to a number of human conditions in addition to mental health. Recent interest and concern in celiac disease, the inability to digest gluten, might be an example questioning the health of the human gut: what is present and assists absorption of nutrients; what is absent or present that prevents absorption. Wheat has been hybridized to greatly increase gluten content to produce better bread. The widespread use of antibiotics by doctors and farmers contributes to reduction of the diversity of microbiota in the gut. How widespread and where? Besides ranchers feeding antibiotics to cattle and chickens, wheat farmers for years have routinely sprayed Roundup on wheat crops at harvest for convenience, so all the wheat is consistently dry. The active ingredient in Roundup is glyphosate, yes, an herbicide, but patented as an antibiotic in 1964 (by Stauffer Chemical Co. later absorbed by Montsano).  So, when wheat, corn or soy products (Montsano produces Roundup Ready Soy beans so glyphosate is IN 98% of all soy products and Bt in corn) are added to prepared foods (as found in center aisles not the perimeter of grocery stores), a person who buys and eats those products consumes an antibiotic which proceeds to kill microbiota in the human gut thus reducing the gut's ability to absorb nutrients and maintain health.

Exactly this was done and published in 'No Effects of Gluten in Patients With Self-Reported Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity  After Dietary Reduction of  Fermentable, Poorly Absorbed, Short-Chain Carbohydrates.'  Biesiekierski JR, et al. Gastroenterology 2013;145:320–328. In my opinion, this article definitively debunks the whole 'gluten sensitivity' as nonsense, and shows that these patients belong in the category of 'functional disorders'. It should be noted that a gluten-free diet is not without its proper problems: not only is it expensive, it can be deficient in micronutrients, the lack of fibers may lead to constipation, and typically patients on a gluten-free diet have a tendency to gain weight. The general message should therefore be: there is no reason to avoid gluten unless you have celiac disease.",-0.0624

Most health classes in schools have shown Super Size Me, a documentary where a healthy man eats only McDonald’s three meals a day for an entire month. As the article states, Americans were starting to eat less and make healthier choices before anti-obesity campaigns became prevalent, but this documentary was the loudest alarm for Americans to get on the path of a healthier lifestyle. Although the obesity rate and average calorie consumption is decreasing, reading that “more than a third of American adults are still considered obese” still shocks me. Even though I see that more and more people are getting hooked into many fad diets, gluten-free diets, and turning vegan, new fast food restaurants are still being built and opening in every corner. With all of these fast food restaurants, reading that Americans are still losing weight is a pleasant surprise. Another thing that stuck out to me was that soda is the biggest problem. Now, many restaurants and movie theaters have the touch screen soda machines that contain over 100 options of different flavored sodas and juices with free refills.

220,"""Children Die Because People are Wrongly Afraid of Vaccines"" : NYT Editorial Board <br/><br/>One of the most revolutionary discoveries in modern medicine was the vaccine. Ever since the first documentation of the vaccine in the late 18th century, they have saved millions of lives from preventable diseases, but recently, many of parents or guardians have not been giving their children vaccines, which has caused annually about 1.5 million deaths of children. The NY Times Editorial Board wrote this editorial in response to this increasing problem. One of the Board's best arguments for why the rate of parents who do not give their children vaccines is that they are skeptical of its affects. According to the editorial, in rural ethnic minority communities, the main concern of vaccines is the use of needles, and in more suburban areas, the main concern is that the vaccines will cause autism in the children. Throughout families, there is a general mistrust in modern medicine. This is one of the most well constructed arguments because it addresses all families, not singling out on one race or class. Another valid argument made was that even parents with higher education were not less susceptible to vaccination hesitancy. Again, this is a good argument because it addresses all types of families. Lastly, one of the main strategies the Board used was providing multiple statistics and facts. This strategy really helped back up the argument because it helped paint a real picture of the problem.

It was horrible to see him decline i.e. to become incontinent, to lose his speech, to lose his ability to put a forkful of food in his mouth, to falter when climbing stairs to his bedroom, to poop in the tub, etc.  It was also horrible to see myself decline in a big way due to stress and anguish. Since he left, I have had breast cancer, and stress-induced atrial fibrillation and heart palpitations.  The heart medicine I have to take slows down my metabolism so much that I am depressed much of the time, very tired,  and have gained twenty pounds which I can't seem to lose.

It is recognized that depressive (and mixed) episodes are far more common during the life course of the illness. I find that discussion regarding treatment does not adequately discuss maintenance for bipolar depression and the increased risk of suicide when moving from a (hypo)manic to a depressive episode. <br/><br/>A significant number of people eventually diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorders initially present with depression, not mania. Overlooking a complete mood disorders assessment is very common, and can have disastrous consequences when antidepressants are prescribed, as I personally experienced.
