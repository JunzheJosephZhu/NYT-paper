0,"""Live and Kicking"" by Andrew Das<br/><br/>In this article, Barcelona is winning most of their games in the Champions Cup and now they will have to beat Europe for the trophy. I think this is great because I like Barcelona and I will be happy if they win. Their team captain, Lionel Messi, is saying that they are pushing their limits to win this cup. Messi also said that when they play Europe he wants there to be no hard feelings because his team has a good relationship with Europe and he wants to keep it that way.<br/>	It surprised me how Messi is pretty calm about this but still wants to win this cup for his family and, of course, for all of Spain. This article makes me feel good about Messi and it makes me feel sure that Barcelona is going to win this Champions Cup. I’m sure the coach feels good about Messi and the team being ready to face Europe because they beat them three times before and they can do it again.<br/>	 If I can change anything it’s for Barcelona to get better and for each individual player to get better at their position. I would also make sure that the key players pass the ball to others and make all players feel sure that they can win.  I would also put pressure on the coach to make him train the players harder and have more practice time. This will ensure that the team is ready to play the championship game and win. ",0.9979
1,"LeBron James May Be Right, but His Boasts Still Rankle<br/> ""There is no I in team"" is the first thing that comes to mind when I read this article and reflect upon the NBA Finals. Without a doubt, LeBron James is an excellent basketball player and possibly one of the best. However, as it was shown by the Golden States Warriors winning the title being the best player does not guarantee a championship. In fact I viewed James' comment ""I feel confident because I am the best player in the world"" as rude and not a good thing to say when there is eleven other members on your team. Similar to football player Lawrence Taylor from the article, it would be okay to say that if you were a solo tennis player or a golf player but not as a basketball player, where you have to rely on other members to help you win a game. Taking on the task of defeating five other professional athletes on a court is not a task one can do. Especially when the Most Valuable Player is on the other team. That is why I believe Golden State won the series and the World Championship. They played as a team. They did not have others claiming that they were the best player in the world but they had other members of the team sacrificing their playing time for each other and for the team. Yes, LeBron James did have other All-Star players get hurt during the series like Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love but to me in order to win you have to use your teammates and be a team player.",0.9972
2,"While I very much appreciate the candor, frankness, and the heartfelt emotion in this essay, I must admit the writer lost me at the end.  Maybe it's because I'm not male (although I am athletic), but the sports analogy just fell flat.  Someone dying while you are trying to help them is like giving up the winning run in a baseball game?  C'mon.....please, or more politely - there was absolutely no resonance for me.   From my perspective, the requirement to go on is not that ""my team is counting on me"".  Who is that team, anyway?  Your fellow physicians?  Or is it your patients, and if so how are they your ""team""?  I truly admire individuals in the health care profession, such as the writer, who can continue to try to help people despite the emotional toll it takes on them day after day, year after year.  To remain compassionate and not become inured, as well as to forge forward in administering treatment without becoming scared or paralyzed (which is what I think the writer meant by getting back on the mound), is truly a Herculean task - it is most definitely not analogous to a baseball game.",0.994
3,"This was a terrific series to watch.  Competitive down to almost every possession, great back stories, great players.  I'm still befuddled by professional, best in the world players who can't make free throws.  But I'm being picky.  What I don't see is the game ""changing at light speed .. selfless, passing, etc"".  The Warriors are terrific.  They have a great system, very smart first year coach and staff.  They are also loaded with talent which gave them the ridiculous luxury of having two all-stars (Iggy and David Lee) ride the bench.  They remained remarkably healthy too.  That matters.  A lot.  We'll never know what kind of series it would have been with Irving and Love.  But to the point about the shift in the game.  If you can duplicate the Warriors model perhaps you play ""small ball"" and beat bigger, longer, slower teams.  Who's going to do that?  How you can possibly even get close to duplicating GS depth?  Within the salary cap?  How many Iguodala's, David Lee's are there out there willing to sit the bench?  At $12mm and $10mm/yr respectively by the way.  Where do you find another Draymond Green at pick 49 on the board?  The stars aligned for this great Warriors team.  But I submit that you still need big guys in the paint offensively and to rebound the ball.  There is 1 Steph Curry and there was one great Steve Nash to run these fabulous free flowing offensive schemes.  Everyone else has to make do with much lesser talents.  The game is evolving but not that much.",0.9937
4,"It is hard for me to separate out what is racism from other issues.  I know I have unconscious biases against blacks having grown up in the United States.  But I know that I enjoy watching Serena play and watching what she can do.  Because she is so good, I don't enjoy watching women's tennis as much as men's these days.  In men's tennis, Novak Djokovic is clearly the best.  But in 2015 he lost to Wawrinka in the French, to Murray in Montreal, to Federer in Cincinnati.  Her skill, power and court tactics are so far above the next best players that she rarely loses.  So when I watch, it is to admire what she can do.  When I watch men's tennis it's more engaging for me because anything can happen. ",0.9914
5,"Morgan is definitely not 100% or is playing with the injury still in her mind. The speed came from O'Hara and A-Rod on the same side of the pitch. Sure A-Rod sometime may need 10 shots to score 1, but I'll keep her up there anytime, no one works as hard as her and her movement opens up a lot of space. Press hit the cross bar and Johnston had a ball taken off the line not to mentioned a missed header, plus a great diving effort by O'Hara. Sure it could have been more, but Chinese played all defense sometime out of strategy and sometimes out of survival. I don't think Ellis will go with 3 up top, and that's ok, but I would keep O'Hara (Rapinoe is too slow and holds the ball to long) in there she really changed that entire right side and Krieger finally had her best match of the series so far. Don't mind having Holiday back in even though Brian finally showed some maturity. I think having Sauerbraun back there alongside helps JJ a lot, but definitely can sit Abby with JJ there for set pieces. Press has the best vision on the team (except for the one time she didn't look at the goal before she to the shot), but a little nervy and still doesn't seem to have a set position. What worries me is going into PK's with Germany, US aren't so good (both taking them and stopping them) and they seem perfect. Let's avoid that at least. Will be a good one. Clean sheet again, 2-0 US.",0.9904
6,"Since I was a little girl, I loved watching football with my dad. The MNF team was always terrific - fun, colorful, kind, and made the sport easy to understand. The Giants were my heroes, and Frank Gifford, handsome and charming, the former Giant, was particularly special to me.<br/><br/>I am deeply saddened to learn of his passing. It truly feels as though a part of my childhood is gone. May his memory be for a blessing, and peace to his family and many, many fans.",0.9878

E-sports player play games competitively for the love, and money. Nick Wingfield signifies e-sports importance: "" Now, for Microsoft and other gamemakers, e-sports is considered a crucial leg to the multimillion-dollar marketing push"". E-sports is indeed very important for Halo. E-sports players play the game the most and put money into the game by competing in competitions. Nick also states: ""There are more than 113-million e-sports fans worldwide"". this number continues to grow and will eventually overtake the casual gamers.<br/><br/>Halo 5 leaning towards e-sports is good for the community and Halo. Nobody wants to play a boring repetitive game that is easy like Call of Duty. I myself know of some people on Playstation 4 that would come to Xbox for Halo. Nick points out something crucial: "" The Xbox One, is trailing sonys Playstation 4 in sales"". The release of Halo 5 alone will make the sells go up. Since Microsoft is showing they care about e-sports many Playstation users may switch over. Deniis fong stated: "" Halo is the singular, defining franchise of Xbox"". E-sports will bring success, fame, money, and community for Halo. ",0.9863
8,"      .<br/>      I totally agree with the definition of the problem - 'one country, on vote' - but I am not sure about the solution.<br/><br/>     What exactly would impede a country, with deep history of corruption, to register a good chunk of its population as 'soccer players' - amateur or professionals -  thus conferring it with a much heavier weight on the FIFA's vote ?<br/>     And as we know, unfortunately, there are too many countries in the globe capable of such corrupted actions.<br/><br/>    Maybe a better alternative is one that already exists in tennis and, actually, on FIFA itself:  the vote weight can be assigned by a ranking of countries based on performance on the field.  So Germany's(#1 in the current rank)  1x vote  would be multiplied by its ranking points, the same for South Korea, and so on.<br/><br/> The advantages would be:<br/>. it's clear for all to see and check: we can all see how Japan did on the Asia Cup or how Nigeria did in its friendly matches in 2014, for ex., -  and how many points each of those team got.  And note that these points are itself weighted: friendly matches gets lower points than official tournaments.<br/><br/>.  it allows nations that invest in soccer nationally to climb in the ranking and get more weight in the next FIFA election.  So if Latvia wants to have a bigger voice and improve their position and weight, they may want to do like the USA and invest in their own local soccer league - and like the USA did in the past 2 decades, constantly climb up..Francisco C.",0.9852
9,"Thank you for your objectivity and honesty, and to people of all races who have risen to the occasion to congratulate Ms. Williams for her amazing accomplishments. For it has been heartbreaking to notice how many of her own countrymen and -women have always cheered for her foreign opponents, especially those opponents of European ancestry. They also cheer for her Asian opponents and those of African ancestry, but only because they are not number 1--or the best woman tennis player of all times, as Serena certainly is. If any other player of African ancestry ever replaces her as the best ever, these same racists will pray for her to lose as well -- every time she steps onto a tennis court. And this unabashed, simmering meanness by so many with regard to this great champion is multiplied throughout the western world. ",0.9848
10,"As a long-time soccer player who wanted to but couldn't afford the extra fees for ""Soccer Plus"" cable packages that popped up as the Premier League became the world's top ""football"" league, I'm thrilled that NBCSN has retained the rights to this property and that it will remain as part of the mainstream cable package. They invested in top British and American soccer commentators, both in the studio and in the gantry, and never dumbed down their analysis for the American audience. And after their initial year, they signed ""Men in Blazers"", a wonderfully funny pair of NYC-living Brits who host an irreverent but tremendously affectionate weekly podcast and TV series about the English Premier League. Even if they lose money on the endeavor, I'm grateful for it, and hope that the other sports leagues raise their ambitions for future EPL rights competitions.",0.983
11,"Back in 1993, Venus and Serena Williams appeared at the annual Pam Shriver Charity event in Baltimore to play a doubles match with Cal and Billie Ripken.  Serena was only 12 years old and Venus barely 14.  When they first took to the court, everyone was saying “Oh, they are so cute!”  As the exhibition game got underway and we watched their fierce play on the court, I looked at my friend and commented that these two girls were going to be making a major impact on womens tennis in the future.  I have followed the sisters ever since and enjoyed watching both of them become two of the best female tennis players in the sport.  If Venus had not struggled with health issues, I’m sure she would still be among the top 5 players today.  I admire both sisters and there is no question in my mind that Serena is the greatest female athlete of all time.",0.9815
12,"Doug, in a nice moment like this, why bring up race?  It's simply one facet of life, and certainly not the most important.  But, since you do, I imagine that the coach simply chose the best players for the team, regardless of race, i.e., the players that she thought could win the most games. That's what coaches are supposed to do.  Would you have done any differently, Doug?  And, if you had chosen some players based primarily on their race to improve ""diversity,"" wouldn't that be racist as well as patronizing to those minority players?",0.9805
13,"ALB, You haven't being paying close attention to Serena's arc on the tennis court.  She has changed quite a bit and I, like many people, welcome redemption.  I, too, had problems with her past transgressions on the court but I have grown to respect and admire her.  Perhaps it's time to let go of the past and appreciate who she really is: a gracious champion! ",0.9801
14,"I put myself firmly in the old school of baseball. Home run king?  Hammerin' Hank.  Single season home run mark?  Roger Maris.<br/><br/>As the saying goes, ""I may have been born at night, but it wasn't last night.""  Yes players used PEDs during a time when MLB and its owners virtually encouraged them to.  Before PEDs ""greenies"" were the thing in the clubhouses.  With so much money at stake you can't blame players for trying to get an edge.<br/><br/>Did Big Papi cheat?  Probably to at least some extent.  But his numbers don't suggest he did so chronically.  Unlike A-Roid.<br/><br/>Was he a ""clutch"" hitter who created dramatically interesting baseball moments?  Sure?  Did he put the Sox on his back and win the WS?  Uh huh.  Did he dominate during his good years the way Big Frank did?  My gut tells me not to the same extent.<br/><br/>So as the writer suggests, the guy is really a borderline HOF player.  After all, he couldn't play in the field.  I agree that if he should be in the HOF so should Edgar.<br/><br/>HOF voting can be fickle.  But let's be clear.  His election to the HOF would be public icing on this man's baseball career cake.  Ortiz' cake during his career?  $143.5 mil.  This is what really counts to Ortiz and his family.  <br/><br/>The rest is all pretty much press fluff.",0.9789
15,"But probably the 25+ million who watched could name more than one of the players. Would be interested to know how many Germans follow their women's team closely and how many watched their team in the USA and England games? So many girls now play youth and school soccer in America, and I think there are something like 400+ women's college soccer programs in the U.S., that I'm sure the popularity of the sport and fan base... and star-recognition... will only get bigger over time. But I doubt that professional soccer, women's or men's, will ever be as popular in the U.S. as it is in Germany because of too much competition from and interest in other American sports.",0.9761
16,"I watch a lot of football - and I mean a lot. While NBC has done a great job in showcasing the league, I really wish they would get rid of Arlo and his crew. I just can't stand the constant jabbering between him and his co-hosts (Le Saux, Dixon, et. al.) Why you ask - well, because he and his crew have Americanised the broadcasts - filling up every single minute with inane and painful blather. Thank god for the mute button.

18,"Great victory for Stanimal and great victory for tennis. Lately it seems tennis matches go by script, the ebb-and-flow of a match seems to be pre-ordained. Consistency often comes out on top. All too often the underdog is just happy to be there or overwhelmed by the stakes. Sets take a familiar pattern, the score stays close for a few games, as the stakes go up the favorite finds a little bit of that no.1 player magic while the opponent misses a key shot.  Happens for two sets and that's all she wrote.<br/><br/>The script for this match had Stan's fingerprints all over. Stan had a game plan and executed it like a chess master. Cannot remember the last time Nole was just simply blown off the court. Brutal, beautiful offence. On this day, Stan had all the answers and tellingly towards the end Nole had no questions left in his quiver. <br/><br/>Matches like this is why I love this sport so much.  Bravo Stan!!!

19,"@ kc — I understand your wish for more human-interest coverage; if done well, such stories can be charming and illuminating.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, experience has shown that in the hands of American corporate media, “human-interest” coverage tends to spiral down rapidly to treacly depths. Shameless amplification and exploitation of sentimentality — think of especially indigestible moments in Olympics coverage — impresses me, as little else can, how true it is that “less is more.”<br/><br/>Such crass attempts to transform sports into soap opera make one miss greatly Bud Greenspan, whose sports documentaries (especially of the Olympics) included strong presentations of athletes’ personalities, and their emotional investment in their performances, triumphs, and disappointments — but whose austere approach evinced a faith that athletic events and performances in themselves spoke more eloquently and movingly than attempts to dress them up with extraneous melodrama ever could.<br/><br/>Greenspan kept a certain distance — and thereby kept athletics at the center of his work, which remains, as a result, infinitely more absorbing and moving than the slickly manipulative, tearjerking network confections in which sport becomes an afterthought. I guess in that light, I’m glad that Fox hasn’t devoted the resources that would be necessary for it to go “The Full Olympics” on the World Cup.<br/><br/>— Brian",0.9709

22,"Some great tennis was played in Paris during the last two weeks, but to my mind the 2015 French Open will be remembered for the CLASS shown by both Novak Djokovic and Lucie Safarova.

23,"Penny, as a 35+ year soccer fan, and one with little regard for the quality of play in MLS, the idea that the women would beat an MLS team is completely risible. In fact, a few years ago, the USWNT scrimmaged against the Men's U-17 World Cup side (the tournamens are competed in the same year every other U-17 tournament-u-17 and U-20 World Cups are every other year, the WWC every 4 years). But the 16 year old boys beat the women by a score of 7-1. Even at that tender age, bigger, faster and stronger than the women.<br/><br/>I am the father of daughters, and I coached their soccer teams for many years. In fact, they both played from Kindergarten through 12th grade, though swimming was their best sport (I also coached them in softball). My older daughter was 9 when I took her to the 1999 Women's World Cup inaugural doubleheader at Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

27,"'The Latest: Hamels, Cespedes Top Names Dealt at Deadline'<br/><br/>The article speaks on all of the trades that occured.<br/><br/>Every year in sports, teams are always looking for ways to get better. Most times, the quickest but not always easiest way is to trade for a player or players. July 31st, 2015 was the trade deadline in the MLB. Major players were traded from their team, some requested a trade to a winning team, others were dealt for the wellbeing of the franchise. Big names such as Yoenis Cespedes, Cole Hamels, Troy Tulowitzki, David Price, all were traded from their respective teams in order to better the team. The trade deadline comes around yearly and each year, the rumors and speculations sometimes affect players emotionally such as when a few days before the deadline, a player from the New York Mets, thought he was traded, and started crying on field, until later the trade fell through. Other times, they affect a player's play itself.

28,"In football history, hyper-defensive strategy is not new.  One famous version is called ""catenaccio,"" loosely translated from the Italian as ""bolted door."" Some believe a modified form of catenaccio helped Italy to victory over France in the 2006 FWC Final match.  In that match, a 1-1 draw decided on PKs, Italy bested a team that was arguably far more talented (Zidane, Viera, Thuram, Makelele, Henry, Ribery et al.).  <br/><br/>While hyper-defensive-minded play may not be the easiest kind to watch,  perhaps the USWNT coaches realize 1) the road to the trophy goes through Germany, and 2) the German side is both more talented and play a kind of soccer the US cannot beat (think: creative midfield).  Most people agree with 1), but you will find few  from this country who can even consider 2) - which might explain Ellis's  ""everything's great"" non-answers in her ""Bull Durham"" style media interviews?<br/><br/>In any event, as much as I hate to say it, the 4th star on the Gli Azzurri shirt does not shine any less bright for having been won by a masterful defensive display that day in 2006!",0.9579

Group stages in the WC are all dependent the previous games and each one is approached different. A draw vs. Sweden when the group of death was drawn would have bee taken by anyone. Both defenses played well and the US was stifled. Only concern was the many poor passes and giveaways, I would play Ohara over Krieger and O'Rielly over Brian. It doesn't matter how many forwards Ellis puts in there, if they can't get them the ball it goes for nothing. Difficult to judge this team off that last match, real tough opponent with lots of things to play for.

40,"Besides an outdated 4-2-4 or 3-3-4, I haven't seen teams with 4 forwards since Brazil old days with Pele. Typically teams pack the back line or midfield and rely on 1, 2 or 3 forwards. <br/><br/>Any more offense is achieved with overlapping fullbacks that work the flanks to supplement the forward line on counterattacks. <br/><br/>The nature of today's game is primarily defensive with an emphasis on that aspect of the game. Goals are, depending on the team, poached by good movement of the field players and being alert to positional play. <br/><br/>A good example of today's modern game is the shrewd play of strikers and second strikers to lure defenders out of their back line and force man to man coverage. This creates a gap that a team can exploit. <br/><br/>Defenses are pretty good though and don't always go for this. Defenses are also broken down by speed from flanking runs on the touch line and service to the striker. <br/><br/>What was seen in the game of US women vs Columbia was a lack of organized attack in the first half. Columbia had more possession and broke up poor passing by the US women. <br/><br/>The US women need to focus on the basics and controlling the game which is key to winning. The midfield needs a leader and Carli Lloyd has looked better in the past. Maybe the team is just starting to adjust to the cup. Whatever the issue are, they had best wake up fast for China. ",0.9259

They struggle to hold onto the ball. And quality shooting is absent. To me, FIFA has let women's soccer down. Their game is not progressing in the way it should. No one will ever tune in again if something dramatic doesn't change to make the game more exciting. People will hate me for saying this but the playing fields are just too big. It takes forever to get from end to end. It just feels like such a physical slog the players are unable to shine. So lets make the field smaller and have teams of 8 or 9.

224,"According the German Press (SPEGEL OnLine), Herr Blatter is seriously reconsidering having another go at remaining in office, which is hardly surprising given he has a serious case of hubris. And then there's the beneficiaries of his largesse; mainly developing countries with developing teams, and the Swiss who see nothing but Swiss Francs around his aura. The awful reality is that this does not bode well for the future of Sports in general, and for FIFA in particular. ",-0.6616

228,From the word go the US thoroughly dominated every aspect of the game out maneuvering Japan at every turn. Sprinting to a quick 4-0 lead put Japan in a state of shock from which they could not recover. I never was a soccer fan let alone women's but this game captured my attention from beginning to end. The fluidity of the game seemed to surpass that of the men's game with fewer stalling tactics. I am now a fan of women's soccer over men's at the moment .,-0.6832

231,"NFL players have been playing tackle football for up to eight years or so in high school and college, longer than a typical NFL career. It is likely that damage from head injuries is cumulative. How much should those institutions be assessed for any problems that players may have at the end of their NFL careers? Don't they also bear responsibility for hiding the consequences of head injuries?

234,"No comment about the Johnston foul is worth reading unless it mentions that a German player, Maier, should have been red-carded even earlier and Germany playing with only 10. The muggings and beatings by the losing German players were even more flagrant than in the game against France. The better team won, in every way including morally. <br/><br/>Everyone can also be pleased that a German squad that with malice aforethought ran up a 10-0 score against pathetic Ivory Coast in group play and was still trying to score when the game ended, won't be going to the final. (""I'd be lying if I said it wasn't fun! It was cool!"" -- German scorer Anja Mittag after the match.) Maybe Germany was trying to beat its own zero-class WWC-leading record of pasting Argentina 11-0 in 2007, when it put the pedal to the metal to score a last goal in the 90th minute. Thank God the U.S. never plays that kind of sore-winner, bullying football. Thank karma and nemesis that Germany and coach Silvia Neid got stopped dead in their tracks yesterday.  ",-0.745

Something is wrong with basketball because you have to be tall to be good at it? Should I lament the paucity of white runners by saying it is ""more and more restricted"" to blacks? Should i cry foul because modeling is more and more restricted to the super young, the super thin and the super beautiful? Soccer is a global sport, but how many tall (over 6') players do you see? Hardly any, does anyone have a problem with football being restricted to the vertically challenged?",-0.7815
236,The article that grabbed my attention was the one on losing streaks in competitive sports. Losing streaks in sports plague most if not all teams at some point in their existence. This article goes over some of the worst cities to have to endure one of these streaks. It has been 147 years since Cleveland has brought home a title. The Cavaliers have an opportunity to break the losing streak in the NBA finals. Will the losing continue or will they end the win drought? The answer remains uncertain but the past does say it will be a difficult task to achieve.,-0.7876
237,FIFA has done a laudable job popularizing football over the last 40 years and all countries have benefited especially the non traditional powerhouses outside of Europe and South America who had a strangle hold on FIFA. It's unfortunate that greed became the norms when it comes to dealing with FIFA but no one can argue with the results that other countries a seat the table. We need to rid FIFA of corruption and crooked officials but the current has done more football since 1930.,-0.7906

240,"Man City took it on the chin, almost an annual rite of fall. They're lucky that the German Pot 4 team they drew was Gladbach, who are likely ruing the sale of their top German midfielder Christoph Kramer to Leverkusen, and striker Max Kruse to Wolfsburg. This is a group with a LOT of central midfield talent, and they're depending on Granit Xhaka...a lot.<br/>For the other English teams, qualification looks straightforward, and there's no reason why Chelsea and United shouldn't win their groups.<br/>Leverkusen and Roma are playing for second behind Barca. No favors done for Real Madrid, but winning the group shouldn't be a problem.<br/>As strong as Group D is, Group H is laughably weak, with even minnow Ghent dreaming of their chances.<br/>Making<br/>Pot 1 be made up of champions unbalanced the draw, badly. Barca, Bayern, Arsenal and Chelsea all playing on the same match day? Faux can't be happy, as they might have to preempt UFC or Nascar.<br/>Many more teams ended up with no choice in groups to be drawn. As a whole, Pot 2 was far stronger than Pot 1. And for Arsenal, drawing Bayern was bad, but once Olympiakos showed up in Pot 3, they knew they were sidestepping the two tough German sides in Pot 4, while Man City knew they were getting one of them. They're lucky to get Gladbach and not Wolfsburg, who look much more dangerous, even if they do sell Kevin DeBruyne.",-0.8006
241,"I'm often struck by the constant ""sorry's"" by my fellow female tennis players. If they hit the ball off the court, or hit a hard shot at another player, or make an error, it's an automatic apology. I realize that this is not the case with all female tennis players (thank you Serena), but I've wondered whether certain women are uncomfortable with the competitiveness inherent in the game or simply apologizing for having a bad tennis day. A new linguistic phenomenon I notice among young men is ""my bad"" as an alternative to ""I'm sorry"". I guess this feels more comfortable for men. Should we bring it onto the court?",-0.8504

There are any number of possible reasons why he might not have liked somebody reading his old text messages. Who would?<br/><br/>Maybe there was ball tampering. I suspect that if you looked hard at any NFL franchise, you would find people cutting corners, bending rules, avoiding scrutiny in order to gain an edge. <br/><br/>This is where I become a conspiracy theorist-- I think that John Harbaugh was extremely upset at Belichick's ingenious, confounding exploitation of substitutions, after the Ravens lost in the playoffs. I mean, I know that. Everybody knows that. But I think he and Steve Bisciotti were upset enough to get revenge. And I think they knew, or somebody near one of them knew that this was happening. And I think this was all an effort to besmirch a franchise that has always been just a little better than everybody else at doing what any professional athlete or athletic organization does-- push the boundaries. <br/><br/>I think if you are a sore enough loser, you could find some irrelevant technicality that your opponent exploits, and paint them as a cheater.

249,"Even though Junior brought me a Rose Bowl victory when I was at SC, and I was saddened by his suicide, at first I had the same outlook; what were these guys really expecting? I'd suggest the Frontline special on football concussions (free online at PBS). The NFL can now point to their funded research at Boston U., but they'd stopped at almost nothing to discredit the neurosurgeon and his institution who first made and published the discovery. NFL paid their own doctor to get a bunch of ""counter-studies"" published. The pressure on the surgeon was enough that he eventually moved cross-country and disowned the whole controversy he started, until Seau died, when he offered to examine the body. NFL called Seau's son and talked him out of allowing it. You can argue these players take a foolish gamble, especially given that they're ever-younger/bigger/faster, but to me Gooddell is simply immoral, and the controversies over cheating and wife-beating are small stuff in comparison with this.",-0.979
