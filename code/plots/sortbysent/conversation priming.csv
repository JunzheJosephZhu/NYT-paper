0,"When Obama was asked about NSA spying on Americans, his TV media response was carefully structured with carefully chosen words.<br/>He said, paraphrasing a bit, that ""If you're a U.S. Person, you don't have to worry about being spied upon.""<br/>An odd turn of phrase, stilted, but telling, regardless. A quick look up in the United States Code, known as the USC, that includes, among other things, the Tax Code, the Healthcare Act, etc - one will find the curious definition of a U.S. Person that is used throughout the ENTIRE US Code.<br/>USC :Title 26 - Subtitle F - Procedure and Administration - Chapter 79 - Definitions - 26 USC § 7701 - Definitions:<br/>(30) United States person: The term “United States person” means:<br/>(A) a citizen or resident of the United States…<br/>Ah! Then…<br/>(9) United States: The term “United States”…includes ONLY the States and the District of Columbia…<br/>Hmmm! Okay…but…<br/>(10) State: The term “State” shall be construed to include the District of Columbia…<br/>…and ANY possession of the United States…which includes the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa…<br/>That's it? That's the US?<br/><br/>Yep. Obama was right: if you fit the above definitions, chances are you're a politician or a government worker living in those defined locations - and yes, you are not going to be spied upon. That's why the politicians don't really care about NSA spying.<br/>It doesn't affect them - so there's NO RISK.<br/><br/>But the rest of us aren't US persons, and we are fair game.",0.9795
1," <br/><br/>	i do say the words “kind of” and “sort of” often but i wouldn't say i over use them in a casual conversation. i expected that i used it more than what i realized after i read this article but i analyzed my speech but and i didn’t.  <br/><br/>	Recently, a recording of my voice was played and i noticed a couple things that i hadn’t noted before. first off, my voice doesn't sound the same in recording and as it does in my head the tone is different. Then, i also observed that i tend to speak quicker. they really didn't bother me they only changed the view i have of myself neither in a negative or a positive way <br/><br/>	Also, i do have a phrase i overly use. it would have to be the phrase “im not trippin” when refering to a situation also i use “ i mean i guess” in a sarcastic tone”. the way they are used is as fillers in conversation. <br/><br/>	Finally, the phrases “kind of” and “sort of” do not weaken language or make for wishy washy conversations. they are just the language evolving to fit the modern culture our way of speaking english is a lot different that english in colonial days. its just changing with the times and i don't see any problem with that.",0.9745

I don't want to do the author an injustice and write off as insufferable something intended to be tongue-in-cheek and charming.  And I don't want to be so distracted by the presentation as to miss meaningful content.<br/><br/>With regard to that content:  I'm okay with waiting to see how some of the actual primary voting turns out before trying to figure out the dynamic of this Democratic nomination contest.  Too much predicting too early comes across to me as too much like trying to put a thumb on the scale.  If conservatives and Republicans would prefer Clinton as the Democratic nominee to Sanders or Biden, they can just say so, as far as I'm concerned -- cloaking those sentiments in the kinds of arguments I am reading and hearing seems to me adding another level of gamesmanship to a political process that already has become too much like a strategy game, in my opinion, and diminishes the stature of the election of our president.",0.5632

118,".<br/>Views do vary on what distinguishes a NATICK from a NOTHNAGEL.<br/><br/>A NOTHNAGEL, named for constructor MIKE NOTH..., is a difficult, improbable, or impossible crossing (as clued).<br/><br/>Some may say a NATICK can be only at the intersection of 2 factual answers, some say the 2 crossing answers must be capitalized in order to have a NATICK, etc. Unless I am shown an accepted definition, I call a tough/improbable cross a NATICK if AT LEAST one crossing entry is a capitalized and is clued to require factual knowledge on the part of the solver.<br/><br/>So, if ""Natick"" were clued as a place name that anagrams to CATKIN, I would say having 5 squares filled lets you solve the empty square with no factual knowledge. But if the same word is clued as someone's burial place, you would need factual knowledge in order to overcome an obscure cross.<br/><br/>Also, I am no expert.
