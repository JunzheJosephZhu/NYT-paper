2,"Illuminating the Plight of Endangered Species<br/>The rate at which many species of animals are dying out at is alarming. Two men by the names of Louie Psihoyos, a photographer and Travis Threlkel, are using a large scale opportunity to call attention to the subject- projecting a film on the side of the Empire State Building. The pair is hopeful to ""Draw attention to the creature's plight and possibly provide footage for a coming documentary"" (Tom Roston). Their idea for a major light show came to life last Saturday where they used 40 projectors to play a powerful short film on the south face of the building. The two film makers attempted to do the most they could to let the world know what they are losing. It is a truly inspiring feat. Not only are these men doing light shows to raise awareness, but Louie Psihoyos has directed the Oscar winning documentary 'The Cove'. It focuses on slaughtering of dolphins in Japan. The work these activists have done is truly inspirational. Especially with all the news coverage of Cecil the Lion's killing, it is the perfect time to start focusing more on problems like this. I am drawn to this subject because endangered species are extremely venerable and I believe everyone can do something to help. More extinctions can and will happen if people do not focus on it. If more people take the time to think about problems like this in the world, it can be a better place for us, and our animal companions.   ",0.9778
3,"There is an important ongoing discussion about this notion, centered in part on the <a href=""http://www.grandin.com/references/humane.slaughter.html"">work of Temple Grandin</a> and on the notion of developing technologies for <a href=""http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/can-people-have-meat-and-a-planet-too/?smid=tw-share"">having meat without livestock</a> (I'm a big fan of this effort; see ""<a href=""http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/meat-without-slaughter/"">Meat Without Slaughter</a>"").<br/><br/>I have good friends who are strict vegetarians for ethical reasons, others who carefully raise beef cattle for eventual slaughter and others who are avid bow and firearm hunters.

4,"Mr Nzou,   decent people everywhere are outraged over this lions death.   It is NOT ok to kill an innocent animal for fun, for sport. That is obscene and monstrous<br/>Cecil was minding his own business, going about his own life, enjoying passing his days with his pride, raising and protecting his family.  He was not ready to die or be tortured.<br/> The lion did not  harm people nor eat peoples food, and many Africians looked at him as an icon.  Walter Palmer is not Africian yet  he flew half way around the world to kill a gloriously alive animal he didn't even know, that was not even bothering him. Cecil was not in Palmer's backyard &amp; and  Palmer didn't belong in Cecils backyard if he intended him harm.<br/>Finally, you don't know me or many Americans so please don't speak for me and make the ridiculous statement that Americans care more about animals than people. Caring for both is a no brainer for decent people.  You don't have to choose! Animals and children have no power, no voice.  Both need our protection.<br/><br/>People who see no horror in the slaughter or torture of animals for pleasure, fun, ""sport"" are like V123 observed ""without hearts, souls &amp; without shame...who abuse (or annilate) others for their own gain""<br/>Mr Palmer needs extradited to Zimbawbe to answer for what he did.",0.9723

6,"Sometimes living life at the fullest is not risking it, but being willing to do the mundane ordinary things, like getting married, raising kids, going to work, buying a house, and paying one's fair share of taxes day in and day out.  Dropping out is easy.<br/><br/>To be willing to fight for one's precious life even in the face of a diagnosis of cancer; in the face of bodily and cognitive decline.  To get up day after day and schlep to some job you hate, so your kid can go to college and have a better life, to face another day of taking care of your incontinent parent, or making the decision to finally give the okay to pull the plug - that's courage.  <br/><br/>Brave is not someone so afraid of living and life that they would rather risk such a precious finite gift every single day.  And for what?   Proof of what? Proof that they cared so little for their own well-being?  Being so careless of the feelings of the people who loved them (and the ones that will end up having risk their lives to retrieve them)?<br/><br/>They were adults and did what they wanted to do.  Good for them.  I feel for the dog, the girl/boy-friends, and, most of all, the parents they selfishly left behind.<br/><br/>Since when is risking ones life needlessly and carelessly living life to the fullest?  Who created that definition?  I think that meme came about from the survivors, who, so piteously desperate to assuage their grief, had to find some way to justify their senseless loss.  ",0.9559

9,"Veganism is historically rooted in ethics. The word vegan was coined in 1944 by a British guy named Donald Watson who was concerned by how humans were treating other members of the animal kingdom, which also includes insects by the way (the latter is why vegans don't use honey, beeswax, silk and carmine or intentionally participate in entomophagy). Look up the history of the word vegan. <br/><br/>You may be confused by the fact that some 70 years later there is now more than one kind of person who calls themselves vegan. There are health vegans, formerly called dietary vegans, who are only concerned about their own health. The moral imperatives of health vegans will not be rooted in compassion for animals. What they call a vegan diet is actually simply a plant-based diet, because veganism is about compassion for animals first and everything else is a derived postulate from that. They have misunderstood the meaning of the word vegan as it was originally defined.<br/><br/>Vegans who follow the original intent of Donald Watson are also called ethical vegans. Many ethical vegans started out first as health vegans and later evolved to become ethical vegans.",0.926
10,"I wonder what kind of alarmist news articles would be written if electricity were invented today. Experts bemoaning the phenomenon ersatz candles that burn all night, enabling people to stay up long after the sun has set. And mock roosters that allow people set up a waking time independent of sunrise. What will it do to our brains? <br/><br/>The reality is that the advent of electricity and light *did* impact the way humans live in a very profound way. And probably in deleterious ways. But the bigger question is whether, on balance, there is a net gain for society. ""Glowing screens"" may cause extreme problems for certain people at the margins, just like with other vices we accept as normal, but for most of us the net gain is not worth the periodic outburst of handwringing about how this new invention is ruining humanity.",0.9001
11,"We KNOW when we are happy, and that always being happy wouldn't really make us happy. Otherwise, we could just pop pills - which, of course, many do.<br/><br/>If Darwin is to be believed - and I believe that he is - what we refer to as human nature (including what makes us happy) evolved in an environment that was very social, very tribal and very different from the artificial environment of civilisation we live in today, which clearly (to the un blinkered eye) most are not well adapted to and thus makes sick; a sickness which contributes considerably to GDP, thought all the compulsive distractions (entertainment), behaviours (e.g. shopping) and medications we need.<br/><br/>If we were the rational animal we mistakenly believe ourselves to be (rather than the rationalising animal we, including academics, actually are), we would have created a society and economy suited to our well-being and long-term survival. Instead, society has been shaped over centuries by its ruling elites and their favoured (invariably wealthy) clients, to suit their own self-interests, at the expense of society at large and its long-term survival.<br/><br/>It is vitally important that academics recognise how they themselves rationalise the status quo, because serves their own personal self-interests so well, and develop an understanding of it (see: <a href=""http://philosopherkin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/civilisation-evolutionary-cul-de-sac.html"" title=""http://philosopherkin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/civilisation-evolutionary-cul-de-sac.html"" target=""_blank"">http://philosopherkin.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/civilisation-evolutionary-c...</a> ).",0.8967

The speaker was a Plains Indian who spoke of the agreement his ancestors had with the buffalo (before white hunters almost exterminated bison for their furs, leaving the meat to rot, thus, helping the white man almost exterminate the Plains Indians). Humans, the speaker said, were respect and honor the buffalo, and the buffalo, in return, would allow themselves to be hunted. Unfortunately no buffalo was allowed to come forward to confirm or deny this story.<br/><br/>Your quote also reminds me of why I could care less what happens to most humans in NY (if I am concerned about anyone in NYC, they are the illegal immigrants that toil under horrible conditions for low wages) and why having visited NYC once, I don't need to ever come back.

We also had ZERO grey wolves left in the USA until we re-introduced them from Canada about 15-20 years ago.

It confuses the mosquitoes, preventing them from sensing humans.  The fact that Kite is not a spray but an actual patch would work perfect for me!

Complete data is unavailable for Zimbabwe, but it is for Tanzania, a country with more lions per human than Zimbabwe. In 2002, 0.01% of all Tanzanian deaths were due to lion attacks. By comparison, 1.7% of all deaths came from traffic accidents. That is 170x greater than deaths from lions. I’d be surprised if Tanzanians thought this meant they should reduce their number of cars. But animal attacks are dramatic and captivate our attention, regardless of their rarity.<br/><br/>I understand how the higher value apparently placed on animal lives over human ones by armchair activists must be exceedingly frustrating. But behind the superficial attention captured by Cecil are substantive issues. Predator populations are decreasing worldwide, causing ripple effects throughout the ecosystem. Fear of predators is often used as an excuse to pay little mind to these decreases. But at a certain point, this fear becomes based more in myth than reality.

As such, it should be fully utilized before resorting to more destructive agricultural methods.<br/><br/>Now that we are past that hurdle, I am wondering then, why some who claim to be motivated by animal welfare and environmental motives oppose the sustainable use of our wild fish and game resources.  I suspect that they are ignorant of the damage inflicted by agriculture and therefore fail to recognize hunting/fishing as a improvement over their own habits.<br/><br/>I am guessing that you simply made up the statistic suggesting that hunting cannot feed more than one person in a thousand, but it matters not.  Even if it can feed only 1/10th of one-percent of our population in such manner as avoids the greater destruction of agriculture, then it is irresponsible to reject it as a matter of principle.<br/><br/>Hunters consume 500,000 squirrel in the state of Tennessee annually, and without significant impact on squirrel populations or upon the habitat upon which they depend.  Add to this the millions of elk, deer, antelope, goose, turkey, pheasant, salmon, trout, bass, catfish, etc and one might perceive that this is a significant amount of food.  Wild fish and game is a staple for millions of families across the US--not at all the insignificant amount that you have suggested.",-0.9617
139,"The forgiveness of the AME people and the families of the murdered are inspiring.  I am not a religious person but I feel that a lot of churches understand the human part of this better than anyone and are a force for good, for solving all of this misplaced animosity and rage.  There is nothing good for anyone in racism or this purposeless and cruel violence.  It spreads pain and suffering to all families.  It is meanness run-amok.  ",-0.971
140,"He absolutely broke the law. He had no right to Kill and innocent, majestic lion. It is bad enough we have upon thousands of poachers killing our planets brilliant animals and the fact we have most of them in captivity because of this is utterly dis-paring. Furthermore, people have indefinitely every right to threaten this egocentric... Dentist for doing what he did.<br/>You obliviously have little education and the fact you're attempting to write about is appalling. And by the way it more than ""sad"" it is astounding. It is humiliating to all that our own would do such an act of evil. It is disgusting. ",-0.975

142,"That is the true point. Both cases are NOT similar, not comparable situations.<br/>This dentist was not ""hunting"" big game, he was not losing self-control and common sense in an unexpected confrontation, as the policeman did who had no intention of becoming a killer within two minutes of his check.<br/>No, the dentist had been planning all along his cowardly, gutless assassination of an aging, defenseless lion, by using deceptive bait and modern technology against which animals have no defense. The traffic stop was not a trick to get the victim within shooting range.<br/>There's not another single ""wild"" animal in the whole of nature that kills in such a diabolical, horrifying, soulless, pointless way. Humans are in fact the only beasts of nature that kill for the sheer pleasure of killing. They will stop only when all big animals have been annihilated.<br/>We may not be able to stop the fate of natural evolution, but we can loudly express our indignation and utter disgust, condemn the practice, and call for a world-wide abolition of ""trophy hunting"".<br/>This is ""sport""? It's bagging trophy heads for cash. The ""sport"" labeling is only a euphemism to cover up the treacherous, barbaric, joy of killing huge beasts.<br/>This is called ""hunting""? No way, Jose. It is simple, basic, murdering, for the sadistic delight of assassinating an innocent animal, to feel aggrandized out of his insignificant life and brag back home about his heroic deeds.<br/>St George to the rescue!

143,"Two guesses.....First one is that Ray lives somehow.  A man with a long life filled with misery always survives to suffer more.  And I thought the body image comment was somewhere between the truth and misogyny.<br/>.........Second I feel confident that the person in the bird mask is the mayors son.  The son is spoken of with the kind of parental distain reserved for a child who is the ultimate, disgusting disappointment to a father.  And the person in the mask obviously had a relationship with Caspere, a deviant who did not seem to hid his perversity much. The engagement of his son in some kind of relationship with Caspere would point towards two actions by the mayor: kill Caspere to be rid of him and get his hands on Frank's money. And who ever killed or had  Caspere killed is a player in this story.",-0.9761
144,"I appreciate this alternative point of view.  But it seriously broad brushes and obscures the issue - like saying all humans are badI I am from south asia, and my grandfather was a hunter - he killed tigers and chetahs and leopards in India.  There are old family photos of him with his guns and the dead animal lying in front.  But he was not killing them for sport.  Villagers who were being tormented and threatened by predatory animals would reach out to him to come out and try to take it out, and that's what he did, because he was good at it.  So i can relate to what the writer is saying here about how dangerous these wild animals can be.  But that's very different from this scenario - where a protected animal from a sanctuary, who is no threat to locals, is deliberately lured away illegally and brutally slaughtered, just for the fun of it.  Even if you take the economical impact aside (revenues lost by illegally killing off a key tourist attraction for a region), just the level of animal cruelty in how this was done makes me sick.  To me, that is despicable, and the people involved should face charges and pay for their crimes, just like they would anywhere else in the world.  ",-0.9769
145,"As someone who has watched people wax sentimental over the white tailed deer that are overrunning Westchester County I understand how you feel Goodwell.  Too many Americans who have no experience or understanding of how nature works romanticize it or think it's not important.  Both views are incompatible with respecting nature, understanding that wild animals are not pets or toys, and that some are downright dangerous.  Yes, every species should be protected so it doesn't die out and leave an empty space in the ecology of an area but that doesn't mean letting them take over.  <br/><br/>You forget that most of us see nature on the television set or on streaming videos.  We care more about animals than people because people have opinions, can be demanding, and can demand to be listened to.  We can ignore animals or say it's someone else's problem.  But understand how nature works, respect other's traditions, no, we don't do that.  We want to tell everyone else how to run their country rather than join a treaty designed to help countries that may be swept away by climate change or lose its ability to feed its citizens if arable land goes to desert.  <br/><br/>That said, I'm still sad that a lion was killed and possibly lured out of a safe area so it could be killed.  They are a top predator and keep other animals at tolerable levels.  Unfortunately they also kill humans and that's why villagers kill them.",-0.9798

147,"Mr. Cox is the poster child for why capital punishment should be done away with.   He is a depressed, and in his own way, homicidal individual who has lost all sense of proportion ( ""the man deserves as much physical suffering as it is humanly possible to endure before he dies”).  It's not about justice when you start threatening the legal opposition with criminal contempt just for filing opposing motions; it's about not letting anyone get in the way be tween him and the vengeance he seeks.<br/><br/>It's sickening that such a man can have the power of life and death over an other.",-0.985
148,"I'm not sure why some readers are quick to be defensive and accusing Roxanne Gay of false equivalency. She is simply expressing sadness that from the black point of view, black lives still don't matter. From the perspective of black reality, the outrage over Cecil's horrible and senseless death surpasses the weary outrage felt over countless death of black men and women in the hands of the police. The systematic death of black men and women is such a part of the fabric of American reality that another reported incident does not spark righteousness and outrage like perhaps it should. We expect it that this will continue into the near future. But Cecil's death seems exceptional, preventable, and a tractable problem for the collective American will. It bears reflection to think about the kinds of problems we feel we can solve, and the kinds of problems for which we throw our hands in the air in resignation.",-0.9867
