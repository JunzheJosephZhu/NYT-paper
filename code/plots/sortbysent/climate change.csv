0,"Kurt -- the issue of the Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) ..<br/><br/>The simple CLEAR-SKY greenhouse-gas theory predicts that night-time temperatures increase, but that this effect is most pronounced at high latitudes and/or altitudes, effectively not observable in the tropics.<br/><br/>Extracting the DTR from a climate data-set is something one can do, but why not just look at trend in the night-time temperatures -- particularly look for trend in nights with clear skies, IF YOUR GOAL IS DETECTION OF CO2-mediated effects? (which some data sets have as an independent variable, and can also be diagnosed to some degree from the data given wind-speed and cooling rate information).<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that the 48 states are pretty far south, night-time warming at low altitudes is not predicted to be so strong, US average.  <br/><br/>Look at the night-time temperature trends at high latitudes or high altitudes ... good example of the latter is Mauna Loa, with an excellent high-quality data record:<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.clim-past.net/7/975/2011/cp-7-975-2011.pdf"" title=""http://www.clim-past.net/7/975/2011/cp-7-975-2011.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.clim-past.net/7/975/2011/cp-7-975-2011.pdf</a><br/><br/>As far as Fall et al and DTR ... the knowledgeable climatologist's assessment is like this:<br/><br/>""Duh!  You are using the worst-possible method to hunt for an effect, in a data-set which is not expected to show it strongly, and then you threw away most of the data with an argument about ""best"" sites, which is not in fact sustained as statistically warranted for this purpose.  No surprise you found no statistically-significant result.""",0.9824
1,"This buys into stereotypes to be incredibly off the mark. Scientists are well aware that professors are essentially managers in much of what they do. They may not get a lot of formal training for this role, but as addressed even in the article scientists know this.<br/><br/>More importantly however, I think there is a strong case to be made that a large part if not the largest part of my graduate education in science is on how to communicate effectively. Scientific investigation is a moving target, but we will always need to communicate it. Whether this is through grant proposals, presentations, conference meetings, or publications, science only happens when we communicate it. A new finding must be advocated for and defended to be investigated or adopted into a growing consensus. This is done with experimental evidence and the scientific method to be sure, but it is still a matter of convincing others of a position.<br/><br/>Are scientists sometimes socially unadept? Obtuse? Sure, but no successful scientist is not an effective advocate and communicator or their investigations. The jargon and standards by which this is judged inside the community are different, but not invalid. ",0.9801
2,"Men. What would they do without the ""girls""? This episode puts me in mind of Crick, Watson and Wilkins and the Nobel Prize for the discovery of DNA. The evidence for this discovery rested pretty much entirely on Rosalind Franklin's discovery of the double helix. Wilkins shared her work without her knowledge with Crick and Watson. They shared the prize. Dr. Franklin was recognized posthumously.<br/><br/>So there is great history for Mr. Hunt's attitude towards the contributions of women in science. I suspect he is surrounded in life by sycophants who feed his ego, or he would not dismiss the contributions of women in the lab in such a ham-handed manner. That he lacks character is clear. I need to wonder about the quality of his work, as well....And the quality of a Nobel Prize.",0.9698

4,"Andy,<br/>John Holdren's and your amplification of increased Federal energy science R&amp;D needs to be augmented by a call to increase all other sciences, particularly the physical sciences. As Gates pointed out the internet has enormously contributed to the economic wellbeing of the US and the rest of the world. But there are dozens of other examples that either arose directly from Federal R&amp;D support, such as lasers, GPS, medical diagnostic and imaging advances, or which were born out of Federal needs, such as communication and computing enhancements using new materials and devices. Even  energy-related R&amp;D profited from undirected research in materials and processes. What I am trying to say is that advances in health sciences, energy and space are heavily dependent on discoveries made in the physical sciences, the kind of sciences pursued in academia and national labs .<br/>As an aside, your first graph shows a dip in all R&amp;D federal support in the early 80's under Reagan, with subsequent increases only in health-related support. Under Clinton legislation was passed to double R&amp;D science support over 5 years, which Bush initially supported as well, but which was abandoned after starting his mid-east adventures. Obama tried very hard to resurrect this path, but as you know, he faces a hostile and science-averse congress.  ",0.9675
5,"On a daily basis, I do feel a drastic difference between the outdoor and indoor temperatures, especially in stores and classrooms.As a shopper,I have noticed that more luxurious stores tend to be colder, than those of cheaper value, which supports Richard de Dear’s claim that “Being able to make people feel cold in the summer is a sign of power and prestige.”As a student,I have also experienced being cold due to the fact that the temperature is set to comfort the teacher that hasn’t been in high temperatures recently.These sudden changes can not only negatively impact the health of individuals,but the environment.The article supports this idea by stating that the hypothalamus region of the brain constricts blood vessels when we are cold,causing our bodies to be less alert and productive.Typically,men are more comfortable with chilly weather,because of their higher metabolic rates,so we should turn down the A.C. to make women feel comfortable.Having the air conditioning too high is a luxury our earth cannot afford.Stan Cox states “Cooling of America's buildings and vehicles has the annual global-warming impact of almost half a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide.” Showing that society’s dependence on the technology of air-conditioning is tearing our earth down by increasing greenhouse emissions.As more countries begin using air-conditioning, we need to moderate our use of A.C.,so that everyone is comfortable under hot climates and we do not tear our developing world with us.",0.9516
