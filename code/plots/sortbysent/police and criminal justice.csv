0,"I am shocked by the editorial video about Ferguson on your first page today, Aug. 5, 2015.  It contrasts two versions of Grand Jury testimony about the shooting of Michael Brown.  It presents selective extracts of the testimony of Michael Brown's companion, Dorian Johnson police Officer Darren Wilson through actors. It does that rather faithfully to the transcripts, but omits the forensic and other testimonial evidence that demonstrated clearly that Johnson lied grossly and Officer Wilson told the truth.  The video leaves the viewer with the false impression that there were two equally credible versions of the events.  This is pure distortion.  The New York Times should be embarrassed.<br/>The best summary of all the evidence was the 86-page report published by the United States Department of Justice. It reported that there was not one single credible witness who supported Dorian Johnson's story–not one!  The forensic evidence and every credible witness supported the testimony of Ofc. Darren Wilson.  It is a tribute to the integrity of the professionals in the United States Department of Justice that they did not come to the result which Attorney General Eric Holder and President Barrack Obama were clearly expecting.  If you read the entire 86-page DOJ report, you will see that my comments above are correct.",0.9912
1,"An excellent article. However, it fails to address the complicity by then Richmond County District Attorney Daniel Michael ""Dan"" Donovan, Jr. in covering up the criminal conduct by the officer which led to the victim's death. All that the article says of Donovan is that he fought to keep the grand jury minutes secret; little wonder considering that he ensured that there was no indictment. Donovan, the quintessential ""company man"" always found a way to 'throw"" any case that was a political hot-potato. I told friends and colleagues that Donovan would use the grand jury proceeding to insulate himself; pretend he was doing his job but when he would actually be doing everything in his power to insure no indictment was returned. He succeed. The transcript of the grand jury should have be released, but anyone familiar with grand jury proceedings could tell this was a travesty. Donovan called 50 witnesses and presented 60 exhibits over a grand jury proceeding that lasted well over 2 months. This how you to so deliberately confuse and fatigue a grand jury that they cannot indict. Many people wrongly assume that double-jeopardy attaches to grand jury proceedings. Donovan could have simply empaneled another grand jury, but the courtroom mayhem was deliberately created by Donovan to kill an indictment, so he was never going to do that. As a reward for his complicity in the Garner cover-up, Donovan was elected the United States Representative for New York's 11th congressional district.",0.9724

3,"The grand jury failed to indict Wilson because it wasn't run as a real grand jury. <br/><br/>The prosecutor, whose job was to present sufficient evidence to the members of the grand jury to convince them that there was sufficient cause to bring Wilson to trial, went a major step further and turned the grand jury discovery process into a de facto trial by jury.<br/><br/>He did this by presenting both sides of the controversy, by presenting the potential defense case and, in the process, muddying the issue of possible culpability and confusing the grand jurors.  In doing so, he failed in his job but won in what we can assume was his implicit goal, to avoid having to put Officer Wilson on trial for any charge at all.<br/><br/>I believe that in a real grand jury process, with a prosecutor making his case that sufficient evidence existed to bring the entire matter to trial, the prosecutor would not have failed and we would have seen the whole question of guild or innocence be judged in a trial by jury.<br/><br/>Instead, we had a grand jury that was perverted by a corrupt prosecutor into a de facto trial by jury, with the result that Officer Wilson walked free, a true perversion of justice, and of the justice system itself.  Institutional racism indeed.",0.9604
4,"DRIVING WHILE BLACK  It looks like the problem in many places in Missouri is Driving While Black.  If, proportionately, a smaller number of stops of Blacks produce evidence of criminal activity than of Caucasians, that difference looks like the smoking gun of evidence against policing practices in many parts of the state.  After all, in 1899, in the US House, Willard Duncan Vandiver from MO naming it ""the show me state.""  Well, the evidence from police traffic stops shows us, indeed.  Law enforcement in MO has shown us its activities, Kosher and otherwise, in lots of very convincing photos and videos in recent times.  Clearly, if law enforcement nets less evidence of involvement with drug crimes from stops of Blacks, one must conclude there's something rotten in the State of Missouri.  So show us the rot already, and clean up the mess!  Let us see the content of the characters not only of Blacks who have stopped by cops, but of the characters cops-who-stop as well.  The public is entitled to efficient enforcement of the law.  Clearly, the MO police, in some places, need to rethink their proven ethnic bias in applying and enforcing the laws they are meant to uphold and peace they are sworn to protect.",0.9601

First of all, almost all of the children's parents who were convicted of being raped by school staff members, supported the fake truth with evidence that did not even exist. These parents are not what create a corrupt justice system, by they are one of the many factors that make the situation more difficult to prevent. Maybe these parents knew the truth, but wanted to get something more out of the situation for themselves; such as money because they already had all the attention they needed to win the case  without any bumpy roads. If the parents were to speak the truth, then the situation would be dealt with in harmony. Where trust is not found, honesty will be scarce. I think trust is one of the most important needs to have in any type of situation because without trust; no justice can be served. <br/><br/>As for the REAL victims of the case, my sympathy goes out to them because being accused of raping children is cruel. The feelings they have must be gruesome. ",0.9599
6,"We are talking about teenagers. Teens are mouthy and do things that defy logic daily because their brains are not fully developed. Most LE know this and act accordingly. Except for those who should not be in LE. <br/><br/>This officer should not be in LE. In what world does an officer get to throw an allegedly mouthy, unarmed 15 yr. old girl to the ground and use his body weight to keep her pinned? I don't care what she said. His reaction was over the top. He is supposed to be trained to not escalate situations.  <br/><br/>I have no doubt that this officer was/is experiencing either primary orsecondary post-traumatic stress due to the nature of his previous calls. I am sure those were not the only traumatic calls in his career, some . But, he was fresh off from triggering calls. He should have declined the pool party call. Unfortunately, one often can't recognize that one is unfit for their job when actively triggered. That is why department policy needs to include debriefing, if not assessment following traumatic calls. But, that won't solve the problem because men in our culture, and particular in LE, are taught that needing help means you are not a real man.  Especially if it involves something related to mental health like VT. He probably was a good officer at one time.<br/>Lots of factors coalesced to explain what happened here. Racism is just one of them. But, I think his mental health was the predominate factor. None of us are immune from primary or secondary PTSD.   ",0.9526
7,"I Love the way Colorado handles judges. Each election cycle a pamphlet is mailed to each voter with three summaries of the judges performance. One is from fellow judges, one from defense attorneys who had cases in the judge's court and the third from people who appeared before the judge. On election day voters are asked whether the judge should retain their position or be replaced. There are no campaigns by people running for the position nor are they any campaign contributions or ads. It is a great system that works. A judge who rigged a case when he was a prosecutor many years before that led to the conviction of an innocent man was very easily removed from office by the voters. I think all states should seriously consider using this system. I think it works beautifully and is fair, impartial and just.",0.9381

If the police were not expected to meet a quota, they would not arrest so many people on flimsy charges. Arresting someone because they have a straw and a pop.  The policeman could have looked through the straw to see if it was being used for drugs.  But, then who would pay the judges salaries, etc. How will the bails bondmen stay in business?

As police, it's unsurprising he would see that aspect — the pathology — since it's the one that informs his job: he's there to stop the pathological acts, the anti-social crimes that are inherent in the inner city he refers to. And he's also right that those areas are wrapped up in their own culture and that of course it isn't the ""right one"", in the sense that it's one that drastically limits lives and opportunity and encourages anti-social cycles — like defiance of all authority, disrespect for school and work, irresponsible living, etc. <br/><br/>I realize it's virtually impossible to pull yourself out of these places one you're born into them, and we could start with non-profit running major birth-control campaigns in those areas.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, you may not like what Wilson said, but he's not wrong.

In most of the recent publicised investigations into deaths of unarmed citizens by police, the position of prosecutor is clearly biased toward protecting the police.  Prosecutors seem to routinely suppress and discount evidence, lead witnesses, and manufacture a grand jury investigation based on the predetermined decision towards an outcome benefiting the officers in question.  If this relationship is distorting the process and outcomes of the G.J. investigations, why don't we separate the prosecutors from the police to arrive at a more fair and balanced judicial process?

A common conception that comes to mind when thinking of prisons or anything affiliated with them is houses of evil criminals who can never change for the good;however, what drew me to the article I have read this week was the fact that it challenged the negative connotations many prisons have accumulated over the years.

In this case, one method of punishment that jails utilize has been identified in a study conducted by Dr. Haney to lead to a multitude of mental and social impairment effects that hinder moral improvement and defeat the purpose of promoting being good citizens. Inmates are not learning from their mistakes and are, instead, ‘losing who they are, and aren’t sure of who they are becoming’. In an environment much like the dystopian society presented in the book 1984, prisoners are forced to live in small concrete boxes identified as rooms with the intent of having minimal human interaction.People who commit crimes must receive punishment by the law by serving their time in jail, but the purpose of the time they serve should center around improvement and correcting their actions in order for them to lead more successful safer lives in the future.",0.1943

Judge Gordon, who has also been a prosecutor, defense attorney, administrative law judge, assistant state’s attorney, and assistant attorney general, has vast courtroom experience with DWI cases. She reminded the new monitors of the potentially life-saving significance of their work.”<br/><br/>So the alleged “craziness” of the judge would not seem to be the reason for the outcome of this case.

It cost Micheal Brown his life. Even with the cigarillos, this was not a just cause for what amounted to an execution for dissing a police officer. Walking in the middle of the road was not a reason for hitting them with the police car to begin with. And what proof did the officer have that Micheal Brown was indeed the thief at that point, other than circumstantial ones? I have looked at the video of the store when Brown allegedly stole the cigarillos. It appeared to me, that Brown had waited to be waited on, which didn't happen in a timely way..not that that was an excuse to just take them. It could be surmised, that Brown experienced in his daily life, enough diminishing to not react reasonably to the police officer's very unreasonable approach to the two men ambling down the road.

161,"Thank you Julie Bosman for letting the world understand the absurdity of these laws.   Here's a couple of points to consider.<br/><br/> Pedophiles are people sexually attracted to prepubescent children.   That means children between the ages of about 5-11.   Once children start developing secondary sexual characteristics, i.e, teenagers, pedophiles are not interested.  Zachary is not a pedophile.  Teenagers having sex with teenagers is a normal evolutionary necessity.   Try to imagine if the human species would have survived if this judge and prosecutor (and this imposed morality) was in place thousands of years ago.   How many of us are products of such a sexual union?(everybody raise your hand!)<br/><br/>Neuroscience has informed us that the judgment part of the brain does not completely mature until age 24 or 25.   Yet because this kid has passed the arbitrary age of 18 he's supposed to be an Einstein.   He had sex without asking for an ID?!<br/><br/>This law, the imposed probation (five years without the internet in 2015) is cruel and unusual punishment.   We don't prohibit the first DUI offender from driving for five years (and that could kill people, but sex...)<br/><br/>I have zero confidence in lawmakers doing anything other than to protect their own perceived self interest.

Yes, we have a long way to go to rectify this predicament, but I do have a sense that things can get better if we acknowledge reality and recognize that we have to work together to make things better for all races.<br/><br/>One thing that's become abundantly clear is that it's increasingly difficult for whites to continue living in a fantasy world in which we rationalize prejudice and injustice perpetrated by institutions of industry and government on our behalf. Police officers who routinely commit crimes against black citizens do so because they have come to believe they won't be held accountable for their actions -- and history confirms that they haven't been for decades -- but the tide has turned and police departments are now getting the message that ""the people"" are watching and demanding reform.<br/><br/>It's important to remember that illegal conduct by police is merely a reflection of what society tolerates , and when officers get the message that systemic injustice is no longer be acceptable they will adjust accordingly.

The officer had just been attacked by this young man, punched in the face and had an attempt made on his firearm. Then, the retreating youth turned and (by most later accounts) came at the officer again. Any encounter carries the potential for someone, officer included, to be harmed or killed. That's why police generally try to get compliance or control, and escalate when they can't. You try being in that situation every day, and see how your aloofness holds up, Mr. Blow. The witnesses (hands up, don't shoot) all admitted lying about what they saw...why is that? We need to fix the issues about having excluded so many from our mainstream possibilities that they have no hope, nor ability to change their lives for the better.

Knowledge of their situation will enable us to understand them, and to avoid any action that would result in harm to ourself. <br/><br/>To ask (to demand) that police put themselves at risk when the criminal element is indeed armed and capable of using their weapon, is simply wrong.

Never -- by the look of it.<br/><br/>Our Justice System definitely falls into that ""broken"" category, at many levels. Far too restrictive bail policies that confine far too many to indefinite pretrial detention in overcrowded jails. Add to that over-criminalization; malfeasance by law-enforcement personnel, sometimes by entire agencies; prosecutorial misconduct; arbitrary, excessive, inflexible sentencing guidelines; inhumane incarceration; non-corrective ""corrections""; punitive, over-restrictive parole. And the ""War on Drugs""; definitely a war, only against the poor.<br/><br/>The consequences are what one would expect from failed public policies that remain in force regardless: horrific jails and prisons; an overworked judiciary; high recidivism; broken families; and ruined lives.

I stayed in the patrol car while the officer did his duties through the passenger window of the stopped car.  I couldn't hear the conversation, but I could see the driver through his back window.  It was obvious that the man was very angry and gesturing and appeared to be yelling at the officer.

Why not put cops in white uniforms instead of military fatigues?    The nation's police do a million different things each and every day:  They give directions. Deliver babies. Fix flat tires.

Counting on the violent criminals’ spirit of self-restraint and chivalry (to target only their own kind) is naïve. This brings us to the larger picture. What has changed since the times of Kitty Genovese? A few things, but one remains the same -- in NYC, only the police and the criminals carry guns. The police are effective when they are around; but most crime happens when they aren’t.  <br/><br/>But consider this: former president Clinton’s DOJ issued a memo circa 1998 according to which, nationally, civilians use firearms legitimately in defense of self and property 80,000 times a year. (TIME magazine, Jan 2013, has this figure at 150,000 a year, perhaps paralleling the increase in civilian concealed carry permits.) And so a question inexorably arises – why do the Authorities in NYC foolishly rely more on the criminals’ spirit of self-restraint than on the law-abiding &amp; trained &amp; licensed civilians’ ability, demonstrated elsewhere, to counter crime when the police are not around? Is this elitism or psychological projection of pusillanimous nature by those who make civilians defenseless?

The book discusses several rape cases and how they were handled by the local police and the college administration (usually badly, and prejudiced toward the men).    IN EVERY SINGLE CASE, alcohol played a pivotal role in the rape.  The guy was drunk, and the girl was either drunk originally or had her (soft?) drink spiked with the date rape drug.    Without alcohol, there would have been no story, there would have been no need to write this interesting book    It is alarming to look at the ""yes means yes"" talk and know that in the real world, at least on college campuses, alcohol doesn't hear yes or no, it just wants what it wants when it wants it.

Jurors are asked whether any of them has a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of having acted unlawfully. The question is definitely not whether the victim was innocent. (The victim's circumstances are usually considered only when the judge imposes a sentence; if a defendant was found guilty of a particularly heinous crime, such as raping and killing a young child or a mass bombing that maimed and killed many people, a judge may impose a harsher sentence than for a lesser crime. Note, too, that sentencing is not part of a grand jury proceeding, since a grand jury decides only whether the defendant should go to trial.) In any event, whether in a grand jury proceeding or at trial, whatever doubt a juror may have about the defendant's having acted unlawfully should not be a generalized possibility, since the doubt must be ""reasonable"" - that is, doubt about the defendant's guilt should be based to the fullest extent possible on testimony of credible witnesses and physical evidence presented to the jury or, in other words, the doubt about guilt should be based on facts.

Browsing an antique thing, a bookstore, in the 1980's, I ran into some late 1950's sociology of prison books that were predicting that taking corporal punishment from guards would force guards to ""make deals"" with prison gangs to discipline prisoners, and the gangs would ultimately end up in control.  This is true.  Plus, police brutality is often based in police feeling that there is insufficient punishment for those who are violent against them (and against guards).  Corporal punishment after minimal due process (for the already-convicted) would help restore guard control and would reduce the ""random"" violence of a ""disciplinary knifing"" that might be lethal.  (And, I have had guards admit to me that handcuffing prisoners and tripping them down the ""back stairs"" where there are no cameras is another form of discipline -- obviously, a caning would have fewer random, possibly lethal, injuries.)<br/><br/>3)  Finally, we must end the war on drugs.

We're seeing proof of this ad nauseam.",-0.9951
305,"Having read Jill Leovy's ""Ghettoside"", I find her argument persuasive. To quote the Times review of her work, ""As Leovy sees it, the problem in a place like Watts is not only the high homicide rate, but the fact that so many people who commit murder are never punished. In the 13 years before the homicide that opens her book, she writes, 'a suspect was arrested in 38 percent of the 2,677 killings involving black male victims in the city of Los Angeles.' This lack of accountability is the primary cause, she argues, of the high homicide rate in some African-­American neighborhoods: 'Where the criminal justice system fails to respond vigorously to violent injury and death,' she writes, 'homicide becomes endemic.'<br/><br/>There are more than 2.2 million people now confined in American prisons and jails, and yet, in her view, the criminal justice system is not only 'oppressive' but also 'inadequate.' 'Forty years after the civil rights movement, impunity for the murder of black men remained America’s great, though mostly invisible, race problem,' she writes. 'The institutions of criminal justice, so remorseless in other ways in an era of get-tough sentencing and ‘preventive’ policing' — like stop-and-frisk — 'remained feeble when it came to answering for the lives of black murder victims.'<br/><br/>If society offers neither justice nor protection to a community, right or wrong, individuals with take matters in their own hands. In a gun culture, that hand with bear a gun.",-0.9952
306,"Gerard Alexander states that John Yoo  ""bested"" Jon Stewart in an interview.  It may be so. I didn't see the interview.   <br/><br/>But it is ridiculous to say that Yoo's purpose was ""to determine what legally constituted torture so the government could safely stay on this side of the line.""  In his March 14, 2003, letter to the Department of Defense, Yoo concluded ""that generally applicable criminal laws (against torture) do not apply to the military interrogation of alien unlawful combatants held abroad.""  <br/><br/>In any event, Yoo's office issued a memo on August 1, 2002, holding that the physical pain of torture ""must be of an intensity akin to that which accompanies serious physical injury such as death or organ failure.""  Anything short of that, including ""cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment,"" is perfectly OK. <br/><br/>Thus the ""quiet, reasonable Mr. Yoo"" gave a definition of ""torture"" that excluded waterboarding, sleep deprivation, stress positions, humiliation, and a variety of other ""enhanced interrogation techniques"".   Even if waterboarding, sleep deprivation, etc., were torture, the torturers could always plead the defense of necessity.  And, anyway, the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction.  All this according to the ""quiet, reasonable"" Mr. Yoo .  <br/><br/>""Quiet and reasonable""?  Certainly a war criminal can be quiet.  Whether a war criminal can be ""reasonable"" depends on your definition of reason.  ",-0.9953
307,"I'm a member of that particular subset of readers, but you keep misunderstanding the particular criticism we're making. Here it is in a nutshell. <br/><br/>Our wariness of black people, particularly young black males in particular parts of town is experience based. We've often been robbed, mugged, or burglarized. We have friends who've been through the same, in some cases worse - an assault, a brutal gang rape, a murder. We see and hear stories of white people being gunned down outside of bars, on a walk to a restaurant, at the bar where they work after the robbers got the money they came for. These are neighborhoods that are normally safe. And then we see that this pattern is borne out by crime statistics; it's not just that a huge majority of black people are murdered by other black people, but that in urban areas, white people are also more likely to be murdered or attacked or robbed by a black person. <br/><br/>And then we see the looters and rioters with the Black Lives Matter movement, who invariably commit their crimes on behalf of the ""abuses"" suffered by other black criminals, be it Michael Brown, Sandra Bell, Treyvon Martin, and now this young man in Ferguson who not only ""presented"" a weapon, but fired it too - at others and at the police. <br/><br/>So our conclusion is this; black people are unreasonable and unsafe, and we tend to sympathize more with the police than them. When black people start condemning excitable and violent behavior instead of justifying it, we'll change.     ",-0.9971
308,"If your theory held then young financiers should be in prison at a higher rate than Blacks. They break laws at a humongous rate but seem to never end up in prison. Cocaine and alcohol is offered at their parties and their offices, many leave intoxicated yet none or very very few of them seem to land in jail even when they have accidents and even when they kill other humans with their irresponsible behaviors, the so called Affluenza defense. <br/><br/>Many young blacks end up in jail be cause they smoked a joint or were drunk and disorderly. Then while in jail they learn the criminal culture. After they get our of jail they find they cannot get work so the criminal culture they learned in prison is the only way to survive. In an unequal society the lower classes are always blamed for their ""criminality"" while the upper classes' criminal  actions are swept under the carpet. Look at GW Bush he was arrested for cocaine yet became president. Could you believe that a Black or even White, Hispanic or Asian poor person could become president if they had been arrested for such? No they would spend most of their lives in jail. It is inequality and poverty that causes most crimes. <br/><br/>As to benefits going to the unwed then it is society that selects against marriage not the poor. They do what the must to survive. Their actions are not maladaptive but adaptive to the oppression visited down upon them by the larger society.",-0.9971
