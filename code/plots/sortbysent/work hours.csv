0,"Such ""resume"" mentioned in the passage has really targetted what our Asian parents are thinking: they are always enrolling in those activities such as, looking for the best school in the city for their children to go to, registering for the renowned cram schools for their children to review what they have learned, or even schedule for children's summertime.<br/>I dislike this idea, though. My mom either. We both think that life is not only about schoolwork; instead, it is about things more! Such as, painting, going on a trip, watching movies, or even making some new friends. It is these elements combined and form our life.<br/>Unlike my friends, going abroad, joining camps, and hanging out in malls, I am going to prepare for the SAT test this summer. I know it will be tough for me, but, this is the road I am willing to take, and this is what I have been asking for since I have my dream of studying abroad. I see this test as a challenge, so that it seems like a game to me. For Asians to gain high scores on SAT, it is somewhat ""dehydrating"", especially the writing section. However, I am planning to conquer it, as it is on the path I am walking on.<br/>Also, I am planning to spend some time sketching and oil painting. I want to fine my skills. After painting all the works, I want to decorate my room with the works to give my room a brand-new look.<br/>This is my summer plan. Intense but satisfying, busy but relaxing. I love it, and hopefully will enjoy it a lot.",0.9919

2,"These issues are so unconnected that it is silly. I don't know anyone who ""binges"" at happy hours in my state, where we certainly have them -- it's just cheaper drinks and food for a few hours to lure customers in. If anything, it makes us *more* likely to consume and *less* likely to get drunk.<br/><br/>Also, happy hours often take place in cities, like mine, where afterwards everyone either walks home or takes public transportation home. If this isn't possible in your community: build some public transportation. And teach your friends good drinking manners so they don't get drunk at 6pm in the evening -- who does that?! And it will be fine. Banning is puritanical and entirely illogical, unnecessary.",0.9663
3,"I've never enjoyed working for someone. I think it goes far deeper than this article talks about. I tend to be a bit of a misanthrope + introvert. I work for myself now and do well with what I do with almost zero interactions with people. Last week, my interactions were outside of work; buying groceries pretty much. I work when I want. I suppose what would make me enjoy a work environment more is less extroversion, less meetings - send an email. Let me work from home (in most cases this is possible.) I really do not like coming into a work place and seeing the bosses or coworkers face. I don't hate them, just..ugh..people. Cheerful talkative people..who keep the thermostat way too warm (I keep my home at 50 degrees.) Add the commute and the first thing to deal with is a meeting. I don't think I'm going back to working for someone. What I do I make enough without making me miserable. <br/><br/>The dream for me I suppose is when all jobs are automated. A basic minimum income is devised in some form that is sustainable budget wise. Use that money to keep going to school, to invest or trade with. Start your own business, do whatever. For me, the ideal would be everyone gets 2 PhDs. No one would really work..but would be rather intelligent. Some say school is not for everyone, but then again work is not for everyone either; we seem to push it despite that. If done well, it'll be glorious the day with automation eliminates most of the jobs out there and a bmi is developed.",0.9605
4,"""You put four children through high school, and you find yourself reflecting""<br/><br/>Three for me, at the same point just now.<br/><br/>I disagree somewhat. Yes, application to the task at hand and hard work are vital to happiness. <br/><br/>However, one must balance that by looking up from the grinding wheel to see a longer view. Otherwise, one can grind away and get nowhere, not happy either.<br/><br/>Also, one must work to live, not live to work. Happiness is in the living, not the working. It includes work, and hard work, and paying attention doing that work. It also includes much more, a more that is at least as important to real happiness.",0.9551
5,"Summertime. The living’s easy. With the help of air-conditioning, that is. The experience of blistering heat &amp; eagerness to find shade are no joke these days. Where can one truly escape the heat? Indoors. It’s a relief to be in a welcoming building after sun exposure. However, indoor temperatures can be drastically different from how it is outside. Yes, we do have the A/C too high at times. It’s preposterous to think that people &amp; myself complain about how cold it is inside when it’s the exact opposite if stepped foot outside. If it’s that cold, why don’t they turn it down a notch? The reason why is that people see it as a sense of “power.” I've noticed that shops have various climates. This represents my belief that cooler indoor climates exemplifies a sign of luxury. Study shows the public building settings are based off of men’s higher metabolism rates. Complaints are heard mostly from women &amp; it'd be more pleasing if they adjusted temperatures. The A/C effects people environmental &amp; money wise. The majority of them during this time of year tend to be dependent on it to the point where it's on the entire day. Is it necessary to use the A/C immensely? No. Even though it’s evident that the dreadful heat can’t withstand somebody’s tolerance, there are alternatives. From the article, it implies society should learn how to save cash &amp; energy. Sure, people have the option to sacrifice a few bills from time to time on the A/C if they please. But the issue is some take advantage.",0.9488
6,"So I have to admit that I couldn't bring myself to turn on the happy hour or prime time debate. I watched all of them the last time around. I have kept up with all the coverage of the various players, too numerous to even keep track of, and just had better things to do, like taking a nap, so that I could stay up to watch Jon Stewart sign off last night.  I won't get a chance to even consider voting for any of them until the actual election so what is the point?  Coverage this morning has filled me in on the low points of the evening.

9,"I went to Greece after college twenty years ago, and was blown away.  The work schedule was remarkable, the amount of vacation was in months, not weeks.  People also retired very young and received pensions and government payments which made their living very comfortable.  I was sold, and very young and naive.<br/><br/>There is an important lesson here for the U.S., but I am afraid it will go widely unnoticed, and certainly unmentioned.<br/>It's actually very simple, like the story of the grasshopper and the ant we were all told as children.  You can't spend your life just lying in the sun and taking months off every year, then expecting to retire at 50-----it would be nice, but it just doesn't work here in the real world.<br/>At some point Greece has to accept their choices, and deal with the pain.

15,"As a parent and a teacher, I agree with the article in theory.  However, I think what we are forgetting here is that many American families with young children depend on scheduled activities in the summer because both parents are working.   Therefore many of our teens have developed a ""dependence"" on such schedules.  They simply wouldn't know how to handle free time without adult supervision, which is tragic.  I feel very fortunate that my own  professional schedule enabled me to craft summers with a good mix of vacation, volunteer work, academic enrichment, and just plain old down time.  For most American working families, this is not reality.",0.8357
16,"Sorry about your back pain, but your sleep pattern is similar to mine...yet, if I count correctly, your overnight sleep adds up to seven or more hours.

18,"I think this sort of thing makes the news because it's  the first time young people on the coasts have run into...hard work.  I worked for a coal company in East KY.  Supervisors regularly were required to ""double-back""...work two consecutive shifts.  Occasionally, they were required to work three consecutive shifts, though this was rare and a superintendent could get into serious trouble for mandating it.  When I worked for a steel company, I knew of managers who regularly left the mill at midnight only to show up again at 5am.  In both industries, it was understood that positive feedback might be heard once or twice in a career and then only when heroic actions had been taken on the company's behalf.  <br/><br/>None of this is to defend Amazon.  Sometimes, there's a fine line between requiring hard work and full devotion to the job and just being a jerk.

If you expected the Dead of the 70s, 0r 80s, or early 90s in 2015 you have no sense of reality.  I did not attend exactly for this reason:  no Jerry, many, many years later.  Nothing wrong with being nostalgic - and that is what last night was about.  My experience:  I was driving my family home through the Washington mountains last night after a long weekend.  Wife and kids asleep so I cranked the broadcast of the show the whole drive home.  It was perfect.  I was living in the moment but remembering fondly those 100 plus shows from my youth.

26,"I call the first two years the ""longest shortest time"".  During the first two years with my twins every day stretched into eternity and my entire life was dictated by diaper changes, naps, feedings, chores etc.  There were days on end when i never left the house.  Every day was a million years long.  Every night was a million years long.  The boredom and irritability that comes from not having any time to yourself or any time for intellectual pursuit (or even an adult conversation) was overpowering at times.  Yet the first two years passed in the blink of an eye.  One day I woke up and my twins were saying ""have a good day mommy"" then going to preschool.   It does get better.  ",0.6597
27,"My internship and 2nd year of residency occured during the ""old"" system, and then the first round of work hour restrictions occurred during my 3rd year, so I had a unique vantage point to experience both systems. Neither is perfect. A few thoughts:<br/>1) The reduced hours did not improve my quality of life. We went from admitting a given number of patients per call night and leaving the next day when our work was done, to admitting the SAME number of patients but having LESS time to do the necessary work needed.<br/>2) We spent a lot of time catching up on what happened the night before, so our non-call days were usually longer.<br/>3) It is important to remember that residents never actually ""asked"" for these changes, and most of us resisted or protested them because we didn't want to be forced to hand off our patients at an arbitrary time. We literally had to be shooed out of the hospital by our attendings. I do not suggest that we were ""iron men"" or something, but rather that we had not accepted the shift work mentality which generally runs contrary to our established code of professionalism.<br/>4) I also get it that there comes a point when residents spend too much time in the hospital so clearly no system is perfect.<br/>5) I agree that limiting the number of patients, rather than the hours, would probably improve patient care and training more.",0.6375
28,"Brooks had me almost to the end. After painting a troubling picture of recent college grads who are uber socialized, uber entitled, uber self-confident yet seriously underdeveloped in work ethics, focus and listening to anyone not in their in-group [I've embellished this a bit, based on personal experience], he then says it’ll all work out fine in the end.

Sometimes in hot weather I'll go outside and sit in the sun to warm up for while, which takes about 20 minutes.  The reason why I'm getting colder in the office as the day goes on is that I'm sitting at a computer, not moving very much, and the longer I do that, the colder I get.

87,"This issue transcends party politics and I hope our elected officials are intelligent enough to see this and pass the  Schedules That Work Act ASAP. I worked my way through college by working as a retail manager. One very large company I worked for fired me for refusing to put a staff member who cared for her sick and dying mother ""on call"" (even using the phrase is ridiculous - doctors are on call because they deal with emergencies, I have never in my life come across a retail emergency) because it would have been inhumane and nonsensical to do so. The only people I ever put on call were those who requested me to (they often picked up extra hours this way). Part of the problem now is that some companies use scheduling software that takes no account of the needs of employees, but only considers things like peak hours, etc. This leads to schedules that are rarely the same from one week to the next. Many of these same jobs pay so little that employees need to work two jobs to make ends meet and that is impossible if they do not know their schedule from one week to the next. ",-0.0387
88,"@Cassie: that picture is from 2013, before I broke my neck and back in a serious accident.  I am way beyond menopause: but what does that have to do with anything?  I never ever said you should not enjoy your husband.  What I'm saying, from plenty of stories I've heard over the years, is that boredom and lack of attraction can set in.  Many women I know complain that they aren't treated by their husbands as they were in their youth.  A marital relationship is a two-way street: both sides have to work at it. Both have to want to improve things.  Watch one of the best movies I've ever seen on this: ""Hope Springs.""  My boyfriend and I were discussing this very film last night, even though it was awhile back.  <br/><br/>What makers of pills like this fail to realize is that sex begins, and to a large extent, ends in the mind.

89,"Many years ago, a friend and I stayed in Crete on a cheap holiday. Our room was above a taverna, where the music and dancing went on until dawn. After three sleepless nights, I was desperate, and went to a pharmacist for sleeping tablets. Instead, I emerged with a package of wax ear plugs recommended by the friendly Greek pharmacist. Not only did I sleep soundly for the rest of the trip, but I have been a faithful user of this type of earplug ever since. They mold to your ear shape and seal out virtually all noise. I have used them all over the world and at home to block out everything from loud parties to snoring. I no longer worry about noisy hotel rooms. ",-0.09

Consistent bed times, consistent wake times, eliminating alcohol and caffeine (and at times even refined sugars), black out curtains, white noise, tracking sleep, improving my attitude, no reading in bed, no screens before sleep, no liquids before sleep... along with various medications. The things that seem to work for me are a mixture of common advice and the direct opposite. <br/><br/>I need a cool room and some kind of white noise or a fan because I sleep lightly and noise will wake me up. One session beer (4% ABV) immediately before bed (no more, no less, and not wine or hard liquor). 50 mg trazodone (doc okayed this with one drink). And, because my insomnia is tied to my anxiety, I need either an audiobook or netflix show to fall asleep to. It has to be something familiar and comforting (like Anne of Green Gables audiobook or Parks and Recreation) so it soothes me, distracts me from my own anxious thoughts but doesn't keep me up wanting to know what happens. With this recipe I can sleep soundly for about 7 hours, waking once to pee and falling back asleep until nearly my alarm.
