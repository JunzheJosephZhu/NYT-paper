0,"Let's employ your advice: ""The history of U.S.-Middle East relations...[is] not one of unqualified kindness and altruism. American oil companies pumped billions of barrels of Arabian oil not for the betterment of the indigenous population but for their own enrichment. Successive administrations...backed the oppressive regimes that advanced America's interests and conspired to overthrow popular leaders. Yet for all its demerits, the record of American interaction with the Middle East is rife with acts of decency and graced with good intentions. The United States was unrivaled in introducing modern education and health care to the area, in extending emergency relief and building infrastructure, in obtaining the freedom of colonized nations, and in attempting to achieve security and peace. On balance, Americans historically brought far more beneficence than avarice to the Middle East and caused significantly less harm than good."" ~ Michael Oren, 'Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East, 1776 to the Present'<br/><br/>Come up with a new theory, Carolyn.",0.992
1,"Perhaps you can answer how this deal is the best hope for peace.  And peace where, because as far as I know this US isn't at war with Iran?  Do you think that this deal is going to cause Iran to rein in Hezbollah in Syrian and Lebanon?  Will the Iranians stop propping up the Houthi rebels in Yemen?  Is this deal likely to cause them to reduce support for radical sectarian militias in Iraq?  Everyone here is outraged that Schumer doesn't support the deal but I have yet to hear someone articulate precisely what the US gets for strengthening Khamenei's hand.  If the Iranian regime is going to suddenly warm to us, that's pretty contrary to the fiery, explicit and repeated condemnations of the regime despite the deal moving forward.",0.9708
2,"Israel simply another theocracy, Ms Valdez? Seems like people like you are so ignorant of the reality in Israel, that it would be funny if it wouldn't be so outrageous. Israel is a flourishing democracy, with a free press, which often attacks the government in no uncertain terms, a Parliament- the Knesset-with freely elected members, and of which the Arab List is the third largest party, a Supreme Court made up of famous legal scholars and judges-one of whom is a Christian Arab- who enjoy great respect among knowledgeable fellow legal minds abroad, and media such as TV shows with commentators in the ilk of Jon Stewart!  Tel Aviv is a major attraction among Western gay tourists, with a famous club life and a gay beach-by choice. A large segment of the student population of the Hebrew University is Arab. One could go on and on. Yes, Israel has the high ground, and Israel is still, though sometimes flawed, as is the US, Ms Valdez-a democracy. The day when Iraq has as its third largest party the Jewish List- oh wait, there are almost Iraqi Jews anymore, they have fled or been terrified into silence-or when Gaza or Syria has a Gay Pride Parade, that will be the day when maybe Israel will not be the only democracy in the Middle East anymore. <br/><br/>And if you want to talk theocracies, look at the country of the Mullahs and Ayatollahs- where gays are hanged or flogged almost every week.  And your own US is rife with racism or homophobia, Ms Valdez-so I would come off your own high horse!",0.966
3,"I am profoundly disappointed by, and opposed to, Senator Schumer's announced decision to vote against the Nuclear Agreement negotiated with Iran. The proposed agreement is in the best interests of the United States and Israel. This decision is clearly based on political expediency rather than full comprehension of the technical details of the agreement which can be fully assessed only by a technical expert, which Senator Schumer is not. I am a lifelong progressive Democrat of the Jewish faith, born and raised in New York City and on Long Island. My respect for Senator Schumer has been ended by his position on this issue. He is unworthy of future leadership positions in the Senate. I urge him to reconsider, although I know that will not happen.",0.9643
4,"All Americans, including American Jews, are united in our opposition to a nuclear-armed Iran.  <br/><br/>We need to recognize that this agreement is a lousy deal - the product of poor negotiating and squandering of the leverage provided by years of painstakingly enacted, unprecedented international sanctions.  But that is water under the bridge.  The question now is whether it makes more pragmatic sense at this point for Congress to oppose the deal or endorse it, in order to minimize the negative consequences of the agreement and attempt to further our goal of preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>I think the suggestion by Alan Dershowitz and Thomas Friedman is a sensible first step that Americans on all sides of the debate should support - a Congressional resolution authorizing the President to destroy any attempt by Iran to build a nuclear bomb.  <br/><br/>Beyond that, it's hard to know which is best - do we risk further diminishing US influence if the deal is rejected by Congress, or might that provide an opportunity to go back to the negotiating table and improve some aspects of the agreement?  I think I'm inclined to trust the instincts and experience of someone like former Senator Joseph Lieberman, who made a strong argument in the Washington Post last week for opposing the deal.  But it's a tough call.  <br/><br/>The terrible negotiating job by the Obama administration leaves the country with no good or easy options.  (PS - I'm a liberal Democrat who voted for Obama twice!)",0.9602
5,"Thanks for your service and taking an interest in this problem involving the whole world. I am qualified in submarines and come from a time of stand-off policies and actions against the USSR, a former nuclear threat but now a partner in the securing and testing of our nuclear stockpiles (although there is some chest beating going on now).  Negotiations was the answer. There was an article in the Times a day or two ago regarding the buy-in by the Arab states in the Gulf region, including Saudi Arabia, for the President's agreement. Oman was instrumental in the backchannels with Iran. Also Iran is a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.<br/><br/>I have a steely but comfortable hope for my grandkids. Give Iran a chance to join the world community and have as screwed-up of a symbiotic economy tied to the rest of the world as we do. ",0.9601
6,"I do not believe anything Obama says or trust anything he does and worst part is I am a democrat.  That said, there are few options now available that can be done or undone. Obama negotiated for his legacy and reputation, not the protection and security of the US. Kerry is a joke, and we will rue the day when we have to make that ultimate decision regarding Iran and their treachery.  As bad as the Shah was.... and he was miserable ad nausea,  the Ayatollahs and others make the Shah appear to have been a pussy cat.  The Iranians cannot be trusted and there fact that they have 3 weeks before an inspection proves the lunacy of the agreement. Whey would they need three weeks to clean up the joint if they are not doing anything to abrogate the agreement. IT STINKS..... I hope congress votes against the agreement... because agreement or not, the Iranians will not abide by it.  The Iranian's ultimate goal is the bomb and .Damn the US, full speed ahead! ",0.9519

8,"The point of sanctions is to achieve a goal of changing the actions of the subjected nation.  But to realize that goal, there needs to be a capitulation by the nation that was sanctioned.  The negotiations were a chance to give Iran a chance to change their actions in a verifiable manner agreeable to all parties taking part.  If you just continue sanctions without discussion or providing an opportunity for change, it leaves the  subjected nation little recourse but to eventually respond with force.   ",0.9428
9,"Obama's vetoes have had a perfect record: 4 vetoes, 0 overrides.  The only president with a better record was Lyndon Johnson (30-0).  Statistically at least the odds are on Obama's side.  But with Chuck Shumer declaring out, slim, very slim.  <br/><br/>The only way to guarantee success would be for the Iranians to make a goodwill gesture.  Which, many would argue, is the deal's biggest flaw and its sorest need.  <br/><br/>Taken in that light, Senator Shumer's actions may well turn out to be just what the doctor ordered.  If that's his intention, he's wilier than we know.  Even if not, Chuck Shumer is on track to becoming the deal's biggest saviour.  Wtg Chuck!",0.9417
10,"Thank you for the complicated insight into the past historical relationships among the leaders-past and present- of Korea, Japan and China.  Particularly the Abe and Park family history.

11,"The likelihood that Menendez's legal trouble will vanish in the radiant glory of his speechifying about the Iran deal are remote to nil.  Can anybody state a good reason why we should trust Menendez to have more integrity in the Iran deal than elsewhere in his political career?  I, for one, fear not.  For starter's I'd adopt the same position the US has with Iran:  An agreement not built upon trust, but upon proof.  According to the standard of the Iran deal, where does that leave Menendez?  We'll find out soon enough after he receives his fair share of due process and judicial findings.  Me, I happen to have a deep distrust of people like Adelman who think they have enough money to buy anything they want.  I do wonder, though, what the Adelman/Menendez deal paid.",0.9332
12,"Here's my question:  If, as the president said today, whether to approve this agreement with a foreign power is one of the most consequential choices Congress will make in a generation, why didn't Obama submit it to the Senate as a treaty, for ratification by a two-thirds vote, as the Constitution clearly requires?  <br/><br/>Another point:  In saying that opponents of this deal ""demanded that Iran capitulate and completely dismantle all of its nuclear facilities,"" the<br/>Times is setting up a straw man.  I, for one, am appalled by an agreement that would place NO restrictions on the ability of the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism to have an industrial scale nuclear program, far exceeding that conceivably necessary for any peaceful purpose, after 10 or 15 years.  But I might very well have supported an agreement with permanent restrictions similar to those embodied in the current, temporary deal.  Even Prime Minister Netanyahu, in his speech to Congress, strongly suggested that Israel could have lived with a deal well short of ""complete dismantling.""  For the record, it was  President Obama who talked about dismantling in his third debate with Mitt Romney, saying “the deal we'll accept is, they end their nuclear program.”<br/><br/>Finally, the idea that nothing better was achievable became a self-fulfilling prophecy.  According to its president, Iran was threatened with an ""economic stone age"" absent sanctions relief.  We could and should have done better.",0.922
13,"drspock,<br/><br/>I agree with your post, but one clarification would help. When you write:<br/><br/>""But before the deadlines for electoral transition, right wing elements stormed the parliament, ousted Yanukovich, who fled to Russia and established a rump government, which the US quickly recognized.""<br/><br/>-- I assume you mean the ""US quickly recognized"" the ""right wing elements [who] stormed the parliament,"" NOT Yanukovich, who, as you point out, had fled to Russia. Though Yanukovich had been duly elected by Ukrainian voters in an election that no one ever suggested had been unfair, the US certainly did NOT recognize him as the legitimate president of the Ukraine after he fled to Russia because ""right wing elements [had] stormed the parliament."" <br/><br/>I'm confident you agree with this clarification. Good post.",0.9161
14,"I quite agree. We don't obsess about any other country in the world as we do Israel. I think my favorite pro-Israel group is the evangelicals who love the fact that when Jesus comes again Jews will have a chance to believe in him, or be damned. That's real support",0.9158
15,"From what little I know of the issue I do agree with your comment, and see the short term objective of this deal, however I am unclear for the moment as to what sanctions are currently in place. Either way it will not change Khamenei's stance or that of  his followers, but seems a good step. Clearly at some point Iran will be in possession of it's own stockpile of bombs, it is inevitable, however to do nothing or do the extreme are not good alternatives.",0.91

Anyone who believes otherwise does not understand the culture in the Middle East.

18,"What you call the ""self-proclaimed Republic of Novorossiya"" is the influence of an intense disinformation campaign much of the world has tried its best to ignore: The sovereign state of Novorossiya. The Western media when it does mention Novorossiya applies denigrating terms like ""self declared state"", ""unrecognized state"" and even ""puppet republic"" to describe the status of Novorossiya.  But under international law, Novorossiya has the same status as any other member of the community of nations: It is a sovereign nation. The “gold standard” of statehood is the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States enacted in 1933 The Montevideo Convention requires an aspiring state to have it own territory, population, a functioning govt and the ability to enter into relationships with other states. Novorossiya while not currently in control of all its territory has maintained an undisputed presence in Lugansk and Donetsk backed up by a seasoned army and security forces. It has a functioning govt and diplomatic efforts are ongoing as evidence by the Minsk process. In a just and fair world Novorossiya would be welcomed as a sovereign nation. But the world is neither just nor fair and Novorossiya is attacked by enemies in the West and blocked on other fronts by economic sanctions and diplomatic boycotts.  But it does have friends. Russia, and S. Ossetia has welcomed Novorossiya by diplomatically recognizing it, an important first step towards international legitimacy. ",0.9072

20,"One wonders if today's Republicans even care about how they will be viewed by history. <br/><br/>Under Obama, the first black man ever elected president, the nation has seen the first national healthcare system, major advances in GLBT rights (the repeal of DADT, gay marriage), an improving economy, opening of relations with Cuba, a realistic nuclear deal with Iran, improving jobs numbers, and doubtless more that doesn't come to mind right now. <br/><br/>Under Boehner especially, the nation has seen a congress wasting untold taxpayer time and money by voting 60+ times to repeal a single law vetted twice by the Supreme Court.",0.891
21,"It’s unfair to blame only “Sharon and Netanyahu” for a claim that  “Israel has lost its moral compass.” The toxic and deadly interactions between the Israelis and the Palestinians have been the result of a failure by world powers to solve the tragic Israeli-Palestinian conflict justly and fairly. Aided, abetted and coddled by the U.S. and the European countries, Israel has built illegal settlements in occupied Palestine for almost 50 years. If she has“lost [her] moral compass” at all, Israel has done so not only “under Sharon and Netanyahu,” but under all Israeli Prime Ministers since 1967. More importantly, Israel has done whatever she pleases only because of the benevolent double-standard treatment accorded her by American and European politicians. The Arab-Israeli conflict would have been solved equitably if there had been, irrespective of gender, an Arab Golda Meir, Menachem Begin, Bibi Netnyahu, Arik Sharon, etc., ruling in the Arab countries. In the search for a solution to the Middle East conflict, no Western government would have dared to be anything but honest, just and fair.

25,"Agreed that the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br/><br/>However, the discussion never seems to get down to the realities of the Ukraine: corruption is a way of life and maybe (at various levels) that is the only way to have any hope of a life and a family there.  Perhaps one could put away the desire for Western gadgets and get down to slogging it out (tasting bitterness) to build a functional nation, but this requires a sustained and persistent effort on the part of _all_ the people.   How can they even begin to understand that when, for centuries, there has been no real role model to operate on?<br/><br/>The people of the Ukraine need to figure out what they want and stick to it.

26,"Our ultimate decision on this treaty is pretty irrelevant. We aren't going to invade or attack Iran. The impact of our sanctions on Iran should be relatively mild as the rest of the world will relax their sanctions.

27,"Roger Cohen’s admission that he does not know what leads young European Muslims “ to “enlist in the ranks of the movement calling itself Islamic State” is commendable.<br/><br/>I must confess that I myself do not know what drives thousands of young European and American Jewish settlers to declare Aliyah, or ascent, the act of going up, one of the most basic tenets of Zionism and move to Israel.  <br/><br/>These people abandon their comfortable lives, under free and democratic conditions, and “move toward Jerusalem” in order to join the Zionist movement in Israel, under racial laws that give preferential treatment to Israelis who are Jews, over Israelis who are not Jews.

As the theory goes, where consumer goods go, so, goes increased openness and democracy. As with most of life, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle.

Now China and Russia (and most other medium size economies) are in the opposite camp from the West and therefore, Iranians will be able to manage sanctions' impacts no matter how harsh (by the western standards). More importantly, judging based on the world GDP rankings (PPP measure), Iran's economy is now the 18th or 19th largest (depending on the source), and therefore they are not as worried. In fact for the independent-minded Iranians, the sanctions were more useful for the economy's long term prosperity than for its short term damage. Why not let it continue if it must? If the sanctions are gone away, so much the better. In that case, Iran's economy will rise to be 9th or 10th largest in the world in about 5-10 years. Either way, Ayatollah wins.

Far from seeking peace with Israel (or even Fatah, as we've seen today, with the dissolution of the unity government), Hamas seeks a single non-democratic Islamic state in the whole of the former British Mandate of Palestine, and that is very far from an outcome that anyone who calls themselves a progressive would ever hope for.<br/><br/>""Offensive""?

That was why Kissinger in that WP editorial called our demonization of Putin an absence of an alibi in place of a pragmatic foreign policy in Ukraine and the Crimea. He's an astute analyst of realpolitik and how balance of power is played in the real world. And he means business and has already won over in the Syrian civil war and negotiated ts removal of weapons for chemical warfare. He's not a skilled chess player. But he is a crafty poker player. And given the rank amateurs in Nato and the United States he is up against in the West, that's all that's really needed. Nato's bombing campaign has turned Libya into Somali on the Mediterranean.
