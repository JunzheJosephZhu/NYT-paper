0,"A question: I've read over and over again that print still accounts for a majority of newspapers' revenue while digital is making gains. What I've never seen is a breakout of how much profit, if any, that digital accounts for.<br/><br/>So can we have that number, please? It may be that digital is more profitable than print. Or not. But this is the key figure, not revenue. The Times and many other newspapers invest enormously in digital, but if that huge cost at this very late stage in the digital game isn't paying off, it's relevant to all of us who value daily journalism.<br/><br/>By the way, I'm glad that Ms. Sullivan noted that although the ""newsroom"" staff remains around 1,300, many of the new hires have been in areas such as ""audience development."" But that sounds a lot like marketing and PR, not news. And it also sounds as if the Times has laid off real reporters and editors in favor of these newly created positions that have little or nothing to do with gathering and reporting news and may even serve to compromise rather than support a vibrant, incisive and independent news operation -- or at least so I've heard from journalists. <br/><br/>So please give us the number of reporters and editors today as compared with numbers for past years. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, thank you for another informative column. You've been doing a fine job, and I appreciate your candor and willingness to sometimes confront your colleagues. That can't be easy. ",0.9917
1,"And Speaker Car Heastie is just as dirty and that won't get mileage becasue he's a democrat....let's face it pretty much all politicians are greedy liars and yet we still vote them back into office, but it's the dems who get a free pass. Three Federal investigations later Christ Chrstie has still not been linked 1 1/2 years later on ""Bridgegate"" and there's good old liberal NPR doing yet another hatchet job on him....Hillary has her own server deletes e-mails and that get 2 stories tops then silence. Amazing how the supposed un-biased MSM treats these stories. Amazing but not surprising.",0.9692
2,"Ms. Charles is very gracious. And I think Ms Deen has learned a lot. I grew up in a place that was considered southern, although in Md. It's called Southern Maryland. Men went across the Potomac and joined the Confederacy. I am not so southern, as my father was Norwegian, but I know about the type of relationship that Ms.Charles and Ms Deen had. I think it is true what the writer here says..Ms Deen was just doing things the way they had always been done. But it is no longer an excuse. It's tough on the people who hadn't gotten up to speed yet, but even tougher on the recipiants of the injustices. I think it speaks well of both women, that they continue to be in touch, and that the ties of the special times they had together are not completely broken, but it speaks loudest about Ms. Charles. And most of all, love speaks the loudest of all. I look forward to the new book. ",0.9688
3,"I agree with the Commenters who are strongly chagrined by the path the Times is going down in regards to the wealthy. I, too, wince (to put it mildly) when I see some of the stuff. However, I am going to take the liberty of adding here the comment I previously made, because I am genuinely hoping for thoughts from some of you as to how you think the Times can solve its own financial conundrum. That is the fundamental issue I believe.<br/><br/>I cut the Times a lot of slack in catering to the wealthy with puff pieces, rich lifestyle sections, and the like. (Today's lavish coverage of Jimmy Lee's funeral in the print edition is an example.) After all, I understand that even my print subscription does not pay for the rigorous, hard journalism I want and expect. The wealthy readers are the market for the upscale ads which pay a significant part of the freight.<br/><br/>Do I like this bargain with the devil? Of course not. However, until the Messiah comes, we should keep in mind that the perfect can be the biggest enemy of the good. As long as I continue to get the good, rigorous articles on complex issues, I will put up with the fluff.",0.9656
4,"A great article, that tries to explain what these Kansans are trying to do without first making a negative or positive value judgement as the underlying thesis. It is so rare in journalism today for an article to explore issues --  even continuous ones -- from a humanizing point of view rather than a sermonizing one. I am not a republican conservative, but this article helps me to understand where Kansas's republicans are coming from in a good way. I don't think their policy is right for US federal policy, but I wish them well to see if it works for Kansas. If it works, let's borrow parts at the Federal level where it makes sense. If it doesn't work, we'll know that it doesn't and (hopefully) learn something in the process.",0.9638
5,"I wonder if the constant admiration of Clinton by the New York Times has anything to do with the 100,000$ donation the Clinton's made to the NYT charitable fund back in '08. I urge everyone to research the donations the Clintons have received and given and the multiple ties those donations have to the New York Times top shareholders. I used to respect the NYT for their investigative journalism and seemingly high standards but my respect has waned with the bombardment of pro-Hillary articles and barely a word about Sanders and the amazing momentum he's gained.",0.9601
6,"Why is Andrew Sullivan trotted out as a gay intellectual with things of interest to say?  Yes, I know his background at the New Republic and his writing on the topic. He seems to be someone the slightly left of center straight community is comfortable with.  I can assure you many gay men including myself find his opinions, which on topics like Iraq, to be all over the place and mostly espoused for his own interest.  He is awful.",0.9524
7,"Thanks Lynn for your wonderful support. Only because of people like you, I continue to write about all kinds of my experience in life from time to time so that all of you can understand and appreciate our culture. <br/><br/>Culture may be different but human sentiments are the same globally. That's the main reason why I am enjoying reading many articles and the comments thereof.

8,"These are the stories behind the headlines that tell the real story of how soccer developed in this country, about Rudi and thousands of others like him, devoted people who usually worked for little or no money, motivated solely by their love of the sport and desire to help it grow.",0.9421
9,"At almost 88 I have a lot of wisdom to impart.  I have always worked until these past few years of retirement.  Though some volunteer work was often work.  I have a grandson going into the Navy.  I have begun to write him letters, no longer than 750 words on specific topics.  I am also doing this with a granddaughter who wants to be a writer.  My own writing will go to her on my death.  Conversations begun long ago and now refined I share with my husband and occasionally write columns or letters to the editor of a local paper.  I am the last of the letter writers and what good friend still alive comment on is my ability to keep in touch sometimes by e-mail, snail mail and telephone.  Every Holiday season my cards enclose a letter on some specific topic not just what families are doing or not doing.  Life is good.",0.9337
10,I often dread to read the comments associated with almost every single article until now. You must read these because they are not only supportive but it's beautiful.

13,I think that it's also great for parents to read to their children.  It can be the only time they have together that's not interrupted by other obligations.  It can give parents a warm feeling to read something familiar to their child as he/she falls asleep.  Even now I enjoy listening to a good story when read by someone who knows how to read aloud.  ,0.9258

15,"When you select the recipe links below, the main credit for the recipe is given to Kim Severson. Dora Charles, the primary source of the recipe, is given credit at the end and the recipe is described as an adaptation of Ms. Charles' original. Isn't this the same kind of credit theft of which Ms. Deen (and by extension all southern women) is accused? Why not just publish her original recipe and give Ms. Charles the byline?<br/>The Sprite biscuits are quite good and you can find the recipe all over the internet, sometimes referred to as ""7-up Biscuits.""",0.9145
16,"Bill,<br/><br/>Sorry, man. Once upon a time -- under Abe Rosenthal, for instance -- smart, well-read ordinary readers, but uncredentialed and pedigreed (which is what the NYT these days consider a sine qua non for op-eds under its new and enlightened editorial leadership), had a fair shot at seeing their op-ed articles in print. These days, unless it's about race, identity politics, victimhood, gender inequality, diversity and inclusion, and other socially trending sexy topics -- and once in a while, a straw man argument proffered by this gentleman -- your chances are slim. So get a credential first, if you don't have one already, and then you might get the ""same platform for more credible and true voices of change.""",0.9144

In retrospect, the article makes a fantastic honeypot, drawing out and revealing the very players that it reports on.  <br/><br/>Great work, NYT.",0.9081
18,"I sometimes worry that more emphasis is given to ""is the book the right length to sell,"" rather than ""how long does this particular story take to tell?""<br/><br/>Especially in a growing electronic world, whether a book is 50,000 words or 200,000 words is neither here nor there.  In the print world, of course, it still has a manufacturing cost to take into account.<br/><br/>I am writing a huge fantasy saga at the moment that will stretch across many volumes.  The main books are 160,000 words a piece, give or take, but one of the stand-alone books is only 56,000 words long.<br/><br/>In my mind, both lengths are justifiable, as is a short story I have written about one of the characters that is just 12,000 words. The point is that the tales are different lengths.<br/><br/>Now, I also have a decision to make. My big volumes I could split in two and possibly get more sales. But do I undermine my own work in that way? Do I insult the reader?  One day I hope they are a fan. I want to be nice to them.<br/><br/>I have read huge books that have held me and I have read short stories than bored me and I did not finish. So what is size?<br/><br/>Without being too corny, satisfaction is the important thing, not size!",0.9072
19," But the NYT reported that, if Obama received congressional approval, he then would have the leverage  to close the deal. It was a selling point.<br/><br/>Oh well, everyone knows that was just hot air. But it makes for fun reporting and reading. Nothing to do with reality. Duh, this is DC. ",0.9052
20,"I was going to say it seems unnecessary to hammer away at the obvious and let his supporters have their moment but after reading letter after letter that feels about facts and data the same way the Republican base feels about global warming maybe it needs to be repeated a little more.<br/>The NY times is reporting the news like it's supposed to, too many people here want it to be an advocacy group for Mr. Sanders. Maybe a lot of America just does't feel the same way about the issues many people here do... or not.<br/>Feel free to keep selling, maybe a lot of others will buy in, but that's not this newspaper's job.",0.9001

31,"I find something incredibly brilliant about Seuss' works. I immediately bought ""What Pet Should I Get,"" and quickly realized that whilst reading the book, I could think only of my partner of five years. I thought of the process of picking a partner with whom to enter a monogamous relationship--a process that involves the stress associated with the knowledge that other (and potentially better) options exist or may later exist and that your parents want for you something that you may not want for yourself. This is, to me, the source of Seuss‚Äô luster: that is, when I was child, I adored Seuss‚Äô silly rhymes and entertaining plots for the fun they offered, but now, as an adult, I appreciate Seuss‚Äô literature for its profundity (e.g. ‚ÄúHow the Grinch Stole Christmas‚Äù and ‚ÄúOh! The Places We Shall Go‚Äù are two obvious and well-known examples).<br/><br/>Other incredible writers of children books include Shel Silverstein, Eric Carle, Maurice Sendak, Lewis Carroll, and Roald Dahl. Their stories entertained me as a child and haunted me (albeit magically!) as an adult.",0.8601
32,"Please read; "" Stephen king on writing"", a beautiful book. The book will make you a Stephen King admirer even if you don't like scary tales.",0.8597
33,"I have scanned the comments on this piece and I am surprised that there has not been more commentary on the irony that this piece ran on the back page of the op-ed section on the same day that Maureen Dowd's nasty, not-funny and just plain mean column comparing Hillary's emails to Tom Brady's NFL suspension ran on the first page. Of course, I understand fully the distinction between news reporting and opinion writing. But surely the Times realizes that Dowd's decades-long obsession with the Clintons is a major reason for the perception that the Times has it in for Hillary. Readers have not forgotten her columns during the 2008 Democratic primary, and I say this as an Obama supporter, then and now. I respect Dowd as a writer and a thinker, but I keep wondering what it is about Hillary that drives her over the edge of journalistic skepticism into what comes across as a personal vendetta?  (The column was also insensitive to Biden, as Dowd merely used his grief at the death of his son as grist for her hate-on-Hillary mill.) Even if what Dowd wrote turns out to be an accurate prediction -- let's say the FBI finds something in Hillary's email files that forces her to withdraw from the race and Biden comes in -- the Times is not doing its reputation, its readers or the national electorate any favors by giving Dowd free rein to foam at the mouth at the prospect that Hillary (and Bill) could very well wind up back in the White House.

34,"I have a number of friends who say they no longer read or watch the news because it is ""too depressing,""  Some are quite economically comfortable and others have recently lost their jobs.<br/> If citizens do not know what is happening in their world, they have no way of realizing what direction this country is headed.<br/>If they won't or can't take time to inform themselves, they have surely given up on individual responsibility.<br/>I believe this is exactly what powerful interests on the right intended.

36,"I'm disappointed with the New York Times. This article is not deserving of the national attention that comes with being in the country's #1 newspaper.

37,"I think I have read every book Mr. Bryson has written (most in hardcover).  He is informative, funny, and passionate.  I jumped on this article because I thought he had already come out with another book.  If you haven't had the pleasure, then pick up Bryson's book on growing up in the 1950's _Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid_.

40,"Amid the irony of this post and Dowd's running concurrently, it's interesting to note some things about the Editor's Picks on Maureen's icky Biden piece.  Firstly, none of the Editor's Picks are critical of Dowd's exploitation of the Biden family's tragedy, and yet almost all of the other Readers' Picks are.  Sure, maybe some of the EPs would have been top picks anyway, and perhaps some of the top picks were below the Editor's standards for tone, but - It makes me wonder the purpose and utility of Editors' Picks at all.  Why do they exist?  Who makes them?  Do they reflect personal beliefs?  Reward earliest posts?  Exemplify a strained effort to represent ""both sides?"" Are they worth it? The editors may as well go undercover and post their own defenses, or upvote, or even censor posts (oh wait, they do!).",0.8101
41,"The headline for this article, which is the same on-line as in the print edition, is very misleading with its implication that the Governor wants to ""subdue"" the state universities.  Once you get into the fine print (i.e., the actual article), one finds that the changes proposed, agree with them or not, are designed to bring the management of the state's higher education system into a real world of streamlined budgets and more efficient operations, like almost every other private or public organization in this world of ours, including the universities of other states.   That's not ""subduing"".  Of course the professors don't like it; they never want anything that's going to rustle their ivy.  I suspect that the real purpose of this article's headline is to provide 'click-bait' for those who love to rage against Governor Walker.  ",0.7967
42,"It is a difficult and delicate balance.  And, as this fine column points out, there are two distinct facets.  Whether making some of its content available for free on Facebook will undermine the Times' paid subscription business model, and whether a growing relationship with Facebook will taint the Times' coverage of news that involves Facebook.  It is the latter that is of the greatest concern to me.<br/><br/>The business side of the Times cannot, of course, ignore Facebook. But how the paper interacts with Facebook is of vital importance to the integrity of the Times.  In the new digital age, the firewall that once separated the business and news sides of the Times is eroding in subtle and unexpected ways. How the news is presented, and how visible an article is on the web site or in the print paper can be almost as important as articles' contents.<br/><br/>When the Times' modified its commenting policies a few years ago, it required a Facebook account for membership in the green-check club, which it then called ""Trusted"" commenters.  Fortunately, the paper later revoked this inappropriate mandate.  But this serves as an example of where the paper should not go.<br/><br/>Today, there are Facebook icons near all Times' articles, and large banners on many sectional home pages urging the reader to visit the paper's Facebook page.<br/><br/>Facebook can be a major and insidious threat to privacy.  The Times must not  grow too close to Facebook, or soften the quality and quantity of its news coverage.",0.7868

And both are important: views of race relations in in one's own community are likelier to be based on direct experience of daily interactions between individuals, as well as ongoing partnerships, cooperation, conflicts between the so-called races. On the other hand, our views of the nation are based largely on what we glean from the media, which is a blend of fact-based information, and ""spin,"" subject to distortions, both in terms of which stories get written and published, and how they are written.

If Amazon gives you a free trial of a service, don't count on what they say; they may charge your account long before the trial is up.  When gangs of amateur book critics attack an author they've never read (this is a disturbing phenomenon itself), authors say that Amazon refuses to remove the one-star reviews.  It can take years before Amazon will fix reviews erroneously attached to the wrong product, maybe not fixing it until the item is no longer for sale.  On the other hand, Amazon does randomly remove four- and five-star reviews of books, claiming that the author is behind them, even though the author insists that he or she has never met or corresponded with the reviewer.

Interestingly, the book only detailed the likely biological and environmental hazards of a global nuclear war. Indeed, the book made only passing reference to the ""unimaginable horror and destruction"" that would occur as a result of Armageddon. It was interesting to note that, in the opinion of credentialed scientists, the world's ecosystems would return to a more or less normal condition within ten to twenty years. Again, no mention was made of mankind or his civilization (although I do seem to recall the mention of greatly reduced environmental stresses due to a substantial reduction in industrial activity). <br/><br/>Since I was raised to always ""be prepared"" for any eventuality, I read every book I could find on the subject.

294,"Margaret, the problem is not just simply excessive coverage of topics, it's also irrelevant coverage and stale articles.  Today's Sports section includes:<br/>- an article about Underarmor's attempts to capitalize on its sponsorship of major athletes<br/>- a long-running article about a guy who balances on 6 chairs at halftime in Cavaliers games<br/>- another long-running article about the organ and organist at Lightning games<br/>- a 3 day old article about how golf is not allowed at St. Andrews on Sundays (a ""non-sports"" article I suppose)<br/>- a 4 day old article about death while BASE jumping (enough already!) - this sad event happened May 16 so why does an article first posted nearly a month later need to stay up for 4 days?  If the NYT ran the same article in five successive paper editions would you not expect subscribers to get a little upset?",-0.9018
295,"<br/>Mr. King, are you feeling a bit insecure recently? Do you have too much time on your hands? Are there not enough voices crowding your head in the past few years? <br/><br/>You should make an appointment with your psychotherapist, or a psychotherapist, if you don't have a regular one, and bring up this point made here to him or her:<br/><br/>""This is not a roundabout way of justifying my own prolificacy.""<br/><br/>I'd say the major reason for this op-ed piece is exactly that. Not that there is anything wrong with that. <br/><br/>It is not only shear quantity of output, but also content which determines who is considered worthwhile to read, and who is not. The horror genre has always been considered a lesser one. Perhaps, it has to do with the ease of eliciting fear responses from ordinary humans. <br/><br/>Jonathan Franzen writes ""serious"" fiction novels. Getting to be too popular is a reputation hazard for writers of that genre, one he went to battle with Oprah over. It may be difficult for you to imagine NOT wanting to be too popular as an author, but such writers do exist. Are they snobs? Maybe, or maybe they are insecure, neurotic, lonely people who can't figure out how come they are lonely. They, also, should see a psychotherapist.  ",-0.9226
296,"It often seems to me that the drunken Irishman is the last remaining socially acceptable racial stereotype in the United States. As a relatively sober Irishman I encounter this as a ""joke"" at least once a month here. It seems that the editors and journalists involved in this story had no second thoughts about perpetuating this stereotype based on a few incidents widely separated in time and geography, and the publication of this article within one day of a horrific tragedy is extraordinarily insensitive. It is hard to imagine a similar article being published after similar deaths in any other ethnic group. Lazy uncritical, insensitive journalism indeed. I support the calls for an apology to be published with this article.",-0.9231
297,"The negative bias toward Israel as shown in so many of the comments is appalling.  I never realized so many Times readers  would be so ignorant or filled with hatred for this country.  Nah, they aren't.  It must be trolls butting in.",-0.9318
298,"There is a lot of criticism one can heap on the H-1B visa program, but this is unadulterated nonsense. The proportion of women in IT in India is far higher than in the US, and has been so since the IT industry began in India. Women become managers and executives, and are in no way expected to be submissive and stuck at lower levels. Your comment sound like it was written after reading a pamphlet or two of colonial literature from the 19th century, and bears no resemblance to modern reality.",-0.9337
299,"I am appauled by your coverage of the debates. Shame on you NYT.  You covered the debates as if this was a reality freak show.<br/>Trump's  proof that the Mexican Government was responsible for sending illegal<br/>Immigrants over the boarder went without comment. Conversation with a boarder guard two weeks ago????  You let that pass? Not a small point when you consider consequences of not verifying the facts that led up to the war with Iraq.<br/>Not one comment about Trumps lack of remorse for the 11,000 casino employees who lost jobs in New Jersey because of his company going bankrupt.<br/><br/>Not one comment about combative Christie's total lack of outrage when Trump did not acknowledge that 11,000 people in New Jersey lost jobs because of Trump less then stellar business record.  And whenthey panned to Christie he actually had a smile on his face and that still did not evoke a comment from you.<br/>Not one word on how Christie balanced his state budget.<br/>And finally not one word about Huckabee's comment that DNA evidence shows that life now starts at conception.<br/>Next time less coverage of snarky comments by Rand Paul and Trump and more comments about what was said and what was not said on important issues.<br/>I expect so much more from you.",-0.965
300,When I read the offending article yesterday I had to check that I was actually on the NYTimes site. Imho it was gutter journalism far more suited to a tabloid publication rather than a newspaper that has a supposed reputation for quality journalism. <br/><br/>To link issues with problems that a student exchange program has with a minor number of idiots to a tragedy like that balcony collapse and it's victims is wrong and is victim blaming and victim tainting. At this stage it is quite apparent that the construction or upkeep of the balcony is clearly to blame for this incident. <br/><br/>Rather than publish this hand wringing excuse laden wet handshake of a response I think a publication like the NY Times should be putting a proper apology in place to the dead and injured from this incident. <br/><br/>If the NY Times wants to criticise the J1 Visa program they should do it in a separate article that does not stamp all over the memories of students yet to be buried by their families. As has already been pointed out on multiple occasions if this was a group of US Student's on a working holiday in Ireland who fell from a balcony would they get the same treatment. I think not.,-0.9711
