0,"Thank you Mr. President for the inspiring letter.  It is hard for Americans to be diligent defenders of democracy when we also have to work for our livings, raise families and care for aging relatives. But if we don't find a way to band together and do it, the task of earning a living, raising a family and caring for those we love will become ever more difficult.  I was very inspired when my college-age son and his friends joined an exciting new group called Democracy Matters, that is dedicated to strengthening American Democracy and trying to lessen the influence of big money in politics.

1,"On a train ride many years ago, my neighbor told be about the respect he and his relatives shared for a 99 year old aunt living with his family.  Everytime she came into the dining room for a meal, the family would rise, doting over her every need.  And, she never once told someone not to help her when she needed it.  Times have changed. Families are often living hours and days away from oldest relatives.  And a myriad of other realities divides the generations, including advanced technology.  People needn't ""ask grandpa"".  They can now ""ask Siri"" or ""Google"".  With government cuts in spending and the rising costs of healthcare, many older Americans are facing dire health care challenges, as well as harmful isolation.<br/><br/>We in Morningside Heights, Manhattan, are resolving this dilemma.  We have created a free-of-charge, volunteer-based eldercare program (Morningside VIllage) where frail elders are not only receiving practicial help, but are included in the lives of one another and in the lives of their volunteers, in many cases as ""adopted families"".  Volunteers must live in the same catchment zone as elders, so the program boils down to neighbors helping neighbors.  LiLY is hoping to spread the word and has begun mentoring other leaders who want to start an eldercare village of their own.  We hope that officials will before long begin to support these informal villages that are so much more cost effective and successful than institutionalizing our loved ones.   ",0.9878
2,"Lots of very sad comments about marriage.  I've been married twice, divorced once and widowed once.  My first marriage had some good times and it produced two very special children, now in their 40's with 2 children each; one is married, one divorced.  My divorce was not my idea but in hindsight was probably for the best.  My 2nd marriage (after being alone 2 1/2 yrs with two small children), was a very good one.  We shared common values and we were very happy.  Unfortunately, cancer ended it after 27 yrs.  I miss him tremendously ten yrs later.  <br/><br/>At almost 72, I have no desire to remarry.  Two good reasons are a pension I would lose as well as some excellent health insurance.  I'm also picky and set in my way and much too old to compromise.  But I would love a nice companionship - someone to go out to dinner with - perhaps even to travel with.  Such is practically impossible to find.  I'm not miserable being alone - I'm a very independent woman - but ""lonely"" probably is a better description than ""liberated"".  I do see two of my grandchildren often and that is a joy - we're very close.  I see my daughter when she has time, but she has a demanding job, travels a lot and needs time with her husband and children.  My son lives hundreds of miles away so I don't see him or his children as often as I would like.<br/><br/>I think being alone tends to breed selfishness.  I'm far more selfish after 10 yrs alone than I ever was when married and I don't think that makes for happiness.  ",0.985
3,"It is never, NEVER, the child's fault as to what family they are born into. We all got the luck of the draw. I have always maintained that it is the most fervently conservative position to hold that we maximize resources and let the market choose. In this case, we maximize the talent that each child potentially has, we give them all the tools they need to succeed, then we stand back and let them do their best. Some are going to go on to great things and some are going to fail, and the vast majority will live simple lives like most of us do. But you simply can't throw away someone before you honestly give them that chance.<br/><br/>Kudos to Mr. Bandura for embodying the best of these principals. Great story!",0.9799
4,"Sesame street and Maria ""aka Sonia"" has been part of my childhood. Now that I'm 35 years old, I'm truly grateful to have watched Maria on SS educating kids about good values and mathematics. I must say she's one of the most passionate educator that make children's learning fun and easy. Best wishes on your retirement. <br/><br/>-gcn",0.9781
5,"Instead of tearing down Planned Parenthood as a hotbed of late term abortions, which it is not, our elected leaders at every level should be giving it support for its primary mission - women's health and family planning.  We should all be embracing comprehensive sex education, that is developmentally relevant from K - 12.<br/><br/>I grew up in affluent white suburbs in a two-parent home.  While my parents, as was common for their generation, did not go to college, there was never any doubt that we would attain bacholor degrees (I now have two master degrees) and have both a career and a family.  My mother worked when it suited her but she saw her daughters rising well above the secretarial positions she held. My mother got me a subscription to Seventeen Magazine, which in those days stress education, careers, athletic accomplishment, and delaying parenthood, as much as fashion and beauty.  With those expectations, I had every reason and support in not getting pregnant.  It was really easy.  This is not the case in low income families, especially black families, where hope and dreaming were regularly stomped out by the white majority where I grew up.  Those messages get internalized and are passed on across generations.  In the decades since we've made little progress in this area, and have actually gone backward with respect to family planning.  This is an issue that is now also affecting the middle class.  We need to start getting this right.",0.9781
6,"The cultural revolution of the 60s was about the hedonistic philosophy that happiness is found in the direct pursuit of pleasure and gratification. The ultimate extension of this philosophy, for many, is the escape from reality with substance abuse. This leads to profound aloneness, alienated, angry and socially disoriented people.<br/><br/>Marriage doesn't work like it used to. The natural gender differences between men and women will be profoundly incompatible with each other in the post-Christian hedonistic culture of the self. In this environment there will only be short term ""relationships""<br/><br/>The traditional American Christian culture taught the young people that the meaning and fulfillment of life was something much larger than the self. So when young people got married as equal partners in goals much larger than the self, these same incompatible features of gender became very complementary to the commitments to God, family, church, and community. Life continues to haves meaning and connection on into old age with extended family and church community<br/><br/>In a recent family reunion, with everyone having  conservative Anabaptist affiliation,  it was quite a happy gathering of the older generation of brothers and sisters (8 of us) and all the children and grandchildren. Dedicated and intact families with beautiful, thriving children, and the cousins making connections with that  real sense of foundational security that the children of Norman Rockwell America enjoyed.",0.9766
7,"My stepmother, a lifelong Catholic, was supremely proud of her marriage of many decades. Yes, she was living in adultery (my father had been married twice before her), he beat her, and she suffered repeated venereal diseases from his escapades. Oh, and he beat me, molested me from age 12, set an attack dog on me, and (when I was 18) tried to rape me. But she was loyal to her husband and to her religion (in which order I have no clue), and proudly proclaimed her happiness. <br/><br/>I'm a liberal, have been married close to 45 years to my very best friend, freely admit that my marriage is not perfect, and have suffered depression (not to mention PTSD) off and on throughout my life. <br/><br/>Does that make my marriage more or less happier than hers? Ha!",0.9734
8,"Oh hell yes! As a parent of a ""high achiever"" boy that has battled depression and intense feelings of being ""unworthy"" since high school I can say with certainty that his mother and I share the root of his predicament. We even had a little sign that was supposed to remind us to ""prepare the child for the path, not the path for the child""...but we didn't. The urge to solve problems before being asked and preempt failure did nothing to help him be resilient. That is the key -- experience small failures to build the tools and strength to manage the big ones. And while he has sought treatment and has taken a step ""sideways"" to reevaluate his path, we've learned (together) that as parents need to manage our expectations, and listen better, and keep our hands (and money, and time) off him as he lives his life. Better late than never, at 27 he's moving forward under his own power, more healthy, confident and insightful, still uncertain but more capable than ever. Thank God and therapists that saw a way to help him re-route himself before it got too bad to recover. And thanks to our son for forgiving us, and never failing to see the love behind the lending hand.",0.9732
9,"It seems like Ms Lee beautifully captured an experience that I share with her.  <br/><br/>My mother did her best to raise us to be fair- and open-minded.   She taught us that Jews were the apple of God’s eye and must always be respected for this, forbade the use of the N-word (even in our thoughts, if possible), took Korean war brides under her social protection, and welcomed people of all religious and ethnic backgrounds into our home as friends, as guests, and (through marriages and births) as members of the family.  <br/><br/>Once we were old enough to be spoken to as adults, the nastier truths came to light.  And yes, I was shocked.  And, despite how she raised us, she was a little surprised when her adult children challenged her comments about racial stereotypes.   Maybe she assumed that we would figure out that she was teaching public (not private behavior), never realizing that her self-disciplined example at home did not allow us to understand that hypocrisy was expected.  <br/><br/>Maybe it is also true that our opinions ossify over time, if we allow them to.  Perhaps Atticus was a better man in his earlier adult years, and maybe my mother was less judgmental when she was younger.  <br/><br/>I am very much looking forward to reading Watchman for myself to see how this astute observer of human nature illustrates how our morals evolve throughout of lives, as we are shaped by outside events, cultural pressures, and the strength of our own characters.",0.9718
10,"I can only speak for myself, a 75 year old still-healthy and intelligent woman, as to what I think has largely contributed to the growing skepticism around vaccines.  For starters, many of our solid beliefs in the institutions that we grew up with and cherished have been painfully shattered. We have seen the dark side of all of the foundational supports in our lives. The integrity of our religious institutions, our town and city crime protection systems, our food protection systems, our  food growing and animal raising systems, our banking systems, our pharmaceutical and research protocols and their impact on healthcare systems have been called into question as to their honesty- and necessarily so.  While a good scrubbing with soap and hot water is called for on all these fronts, it leaves large numbers of our nation stunned, confused and often at a loss on how to create a happy and healthy life for our children and grandchildren.  I’m saying that what we believed in has been turned on its head.  We all love and want to protect our children. But there is a wide-spread reasonable doubt of what we could once count on.<br/>Who knows who is right?<br/>All I know is it seems perfectly reasonable that parents everywhere have every right to make their own decisions about the safety of mandated and regulated health practices. We are truly not living in Kansas anymore, except the folks that are living in Kansas.  ",0.9674
11,"Really, Stacee - all camps everywhere have excellent supporting materials?<br/><br/>Some do - the daycamp I used for my son for the last several years; they were a paragon of excellent organization and continuous improvement. Comes with being run by one extended family for *decades*.   But that wasn't my experience everywhere.<br/><br/>And there the gotchas in the background a camp doesn't see unless the parent brings it up, like the medication that needs to be provided ahead of time, but the refill policy the parent needs to deal with is strict about intervals.   And the physical that can't be performed (or the parent must pay out of pocket) because the previous years' physical was less than 365 days previous to any date acceptable to the camp.  (and, pertaining to after school care, the school district transportation department's policy that a parent needs to have the forms in for bus transportation - the April of the previous year!)  And other suchlike traps.  Every agency we deal with has policies, boy do they have policies.  They clash.   This article is just perfect in bringing out the humor and frustration of it.",0.9656
12,"Her Ghostown performance is/was uplifting. Perhaps we are and should still be looking out to our eldest for advises on life, for maturity, for wisdom to help us calm our tempers and tantrums, and there is nothing wrong with that. Hopefully, age do change people's mind for the better. Well - it did change mine. And so perhaps in looking for the voice, which with age has only become more clear and pure, we want to scratch off all the armor-like pink glitter and feather hats non longer needed to give one self confidence.",0.9604
13,"To India: In my very humble perspective as a professor with 30 years experience, it would have been interesting for you to ask your daughter why she cared so much about the respect of her friends since that so-called ""respect"" was, in fact, judgment. So you were accepting that your daughter was giving in to the judgment of her friends who, your daughter thought, were going to look down on her if she didn't go to a so-called ""good school."" And my guess is that your daughter went on to an Ivy and (likely) spent her four years succeeding, yes, but also being judged by her friends...and accepting it. Just a thought. So Julie Scelfo...If I'm at all on point here, then I'm not sure it's such a ""clever response"" but, rather, one that played into the very problem that you're discussing in this article.",0.9577
14,"Where are this boy's siblings?  Had child protective services been involved in the past?  If so, why was this child left in a miserable situation.?  If not, why not?<br/><br/>Concerning the vicious cycle of poverty, I'm truly torn.  I believe the vast majority of poorer people would work their behinds off to improve their situation if given the chance and some guidance.  But I have also worked with the subgroup who are as committed to using the support systems as is any entrepreneur to his company's success.   Lest anyone assume a racial slur, my first experience with this was with the occasional white appalachian man who appeared in the house monthly to collect his portion of the welfare check and make certain every female (including his own granddaughters) was pregnant-- true story!

16,a life as segregated between the sexes as in Saudi Arabia - incredible!  What is  the point with very much money if not  the privilege of keeping a professional staff to liberate one from  the tasks involved with running homes raising children and grooming oneself?

17,"My son is like that too - incessant talking about Percy Jackson AND Minecraft.  Lucky us.

I want to hear about your day, your friends, your homework, your sports, just no    more     Percy    Jackson.  With him, a lot of his peers also play Minecraft, but either haven't discovered or have already outgrown PJ, and I've seen his friends acting bored when he talks about it.   In this matter,, we talked to him about reading social cues if people are being polite or are really interested, and if the former, just stop.  He's gotten a little better.

18,"Blue Jay, due to his incredibly difficult circumstances, has to be a deeply traumatized kid. It's possible in his own way that he is 'testing' you. Also, he could be feeling a lot of rage (very normal) at how his own mother is unable to care for him right now. Personally (I am no expert) I would try to look for ways for him to safely vent and deal with his feelings (you may want the help of an experienced professional in this.)<br/><br/>I would echo Ramona's comment below. Don't let it become a situation where Ryan is always the 'good one' and BlueJay the one who is acting out 'unreasonably' (he has his reasons). That has the danger of reinforcing his status as the outsider, the one who doesn't belong. What he needs now, as you know, more than anyone else, is belonging and acceptance.<br/><br/>If you or Ryan or anyone else were in his shoes we would most likely be acting in exactly the same way. <br/><br/>Sadly, when the primal bound of love and care is broken with a child's biological mother, the feelings of abandonment and rage can be overwhelming, especially for little kids. We can look at it and rationalize it all we want, but it's an innate feeling. It is probably very intensely difficult and very triggering for BlueJay to have to see your connection with Ryan every single day. He is probably asking himself (even subconsciously) why his mother couldn't take care of him the way you have always taken care of Ryan.<br/><br/>It sounds like you a doing a great job!",0.9388
19,"Hi Mali, You write: ""I am so tired of making sure everything happens."" I'm totally the same way and the answer truly is to let it go.  I'm travelling for the first time next week, leaving my 2.5 year old and 10 month old with their Dad and I'm certain things won't happen as I would like.  Dad will likely allow them to watch hours of TV while he works on his laptop.  Dinner will likely be hot dogs and the kids will be sent to be in the clothing that they wore all day. Although this is not an ideal situation, he is a parent too and a couple of days of this is totally fine.

21,"Some commenters would like to turn this broad-brush analysis of the effect growing up in a one or two parent family has on a state's children into a question of ""which came first the chicken or the egg"": Are two parent families a product of a more secure family economic position or does economic security provide more support for the two parent family model?  <br/><br/>Certainly the lack of safety nets for families found in the ""southern tier"" of states makes it more difficult for families to remain intact throughout a child's life.  Greater rates of imprisonment, earlier deaths and more people affected by the legacy of not allowing slaves to marry or to retain custody of their children are probable factors, too.<br/><br/>The ""northern tier of states have not been without challenges to meet in supporting all families.  Many states have welcomed significant numbers of refugees from failed nations or allies from failed wars; many states are still struggling to assimilate the significant percentage of Native Americans often confined to isolated tribal lands without adequate services.  Educational progress leading to economic progress has been uneven at best.<br/><br/>It is, however, troubling to watch states like Kansas and Wisconsin turn their backs on what contributed to supporting strong families as voters are seduced by an ideology which promises what it has not delivered elsewhere.<br/>Choosing effective policies to support healthy communities and families of all sizes is today's serious challenge.",0.9366

Fast forward years later, new wife, new kids. He can't go to his kids school. For anyevent, performance, teacher conference nothing. Also he was only supposed to be on it for a certain time period.

As a result, me and my siblings and cousins are educators, lawyers, professors, physicians and businesspeople.  We represent our parents' and grandparents' ""American dream"" and their collective hard work and sacrifice. As my grandfather said: ""This could only happen in America.""  Sure, if I was born to a family that did not embody these core values, and instead followed a frivolous, spendthrift, abusive, and dysfunctional lifestyle, I wouldn't be as fulfilled as I am now.

I like that the show is dealing with important issues, but it's not just going to be about that.<br/><br/>With respect to Cait and her family, I found myself siding more with the family.  Cait seemed to want them to understand her side of everything without paying much attention to their side.  You very quickly pass over the ""distraction"" comment, I can see how that could come across as hurtful to them!  I would never talk about my family members as distractions (and I'm not all that close to them).<br/><br/>Her comment about Kris was also a little thoughtless - if Kris had been more accepting?  Kris married a man, perhaps she doesn't want to be married to a woman?  That seems understandable.  Expecting that they can stay friends is one thing, but staying married is quite another.<br/><br/>I'm early in transitioning myself, so I am very much supportive of what anyone is going through, but it doesn't give 100% cover to do and say anything you want, at least not without acknowledging later that you could have done/said it better.<br/><br/>I also would like someone to tell Cait to stop telling her family members ""not to go there.""

We must avoid trashing our credibility by exaggerating risk while still admitting that unfiltered, unsupervised screen use can be dangerous in many ways. Yes everybody's doing it. Parents are struggling to supervise appropriately. It's not going away anytime soon. How about we all have respectful discussions about how to prevent problems while promoting benefit?

Many see this as a moral failing, but I do not. I agree with the commenter who said that Ms. Wade probably grew up in a society where the norm was having children before you have a way to support them.

Perhaps they have more of a maternal instinct that drives them to make these sacrifices if it's necessary, but that doesn't make it an ideal situation (unless you're a husband with no empathy for your wife, of course). Why is it okay to exclusively bend women into the childcare role as opposed to aiming toward a more equal partnership that is comfortable and fulfilling for both genders?<br/><br/>Raising children in a nuclear family in the modern world is not natural.

These families stressed doing well in school as adolescents but also believed in early marriages to men not of their own choosing - a seriously mixed signal. <br/><br/>And on the other, was British society which they found alien, rejecting, and condescending. Their not very assimilated families lived in a Muslim enclave and they went to a nearly all Muslim school. The wider world was seen as a mocking presence. They resented this. And chronic resentment is a very corrosive emotion - worse in a lot of ways than anger, which can motivate one postively as well as negatively. <br/><br/>ISIS was a way out, a way to be accepted and valued. Of course this was an illusion, a carefully crafted lie. It was a trap. <br/><br/>There is a lot of blame to go around here, but I mostly look at the families. They should have better prepared their girls to live in the world they had chosen to raise them in. You can't immigrate to a new country and expect the old country to be replicated there.

In 2010 Kaiser Family Foundation Study released statistics that read, “The average 8- to 10-year-old spends nearly eight hours a day with a variety of different media, and older children and teenagers spend more than 11 hours per day.” The amount of time spent on electronics is time that could be used fundamentally for something productive.<br/>The worst part is, is that the parents have fault in it as well. Kaiser also stated, “Many parents seem to have few rules about use of media by their children and adolescents.” As Jane E. Body said “Parents, [are]grateful for ways to calm disruptive children,” but there are other ways of doing so in a manner that is beneficial for the child.<br/>When children or teenagers use electronics too often they, “lose the ability to focus on what is most important, a trait critical to the deep thought and problem solving needed for many jobs and other endeavors later in life,” just as Brody explains.
