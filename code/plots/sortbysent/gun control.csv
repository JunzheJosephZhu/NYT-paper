0,"Outstanding observation of The Donald. Aside from the flash, he is doing all of the candidates a great favor by putting their feet to the fire. Mind you, he is not doing it as a favor, but he is showing that he does not fear anything. Fear itself? We know what that is. In the recent past, we have seen Republican candidates all raise their hands about whether or not they believed in climate change, in creationism, etc. Most of them are simply afraid to stand for something that may set them apart from the voting base they perceive as locked into a checklist. The Donald simply does not look at things in lock-step, and his numbers rise. Get it other candidates? Stand up for yourself. You have nothing to fear but fear itself. You too Hillary!",0.9702
1,"OK.  The NRA has won.  300,000,000 guns out there, for a population of 330,000,000.  If nothing has been done since the massacre of those elementary students in Conn., then nothing will ever be done.  So, accept the fact that the NRA has won.  What to do now?

4,"I don't get this.  The officer starts off behaving very professionally and courteously.  What made him fire his weapon?  Did he panic? Was his ego threatened?  Insufficient training?  Some inherent personality or character disorder?  I am sure race played a part, but to simply explain it on that basis misses the opportunity to understand these shootings better and to learn how to prevent it from happening again.  I would hope this comes out in trial, but most likely it won't.  I am not trying to rationalize this but we need to understand all contributing factors if we hope to solve this problem.",0.8431

27,"First, this really makes me mad.  No one has the right to go trash public land for their own purpose, and responsible gun owners know that this behavior is dangerous.  From a more pragmatic standpoint, this is the result of gun ranges that are being run out of business because of local laws and high insurance.  <br/><br/>Why not providing funding and insurance for good gun ranges? We provide public money for golf courses, swimming pools, and a variety of parks. Why not provide public money to create safe, modern gun ranges so that people have a good place to go shoot?  Talk to anyone that shoots about trying to find a gun range that doesn't cost a ton of money.  Think of it like the public pool, which takes some nominal fee to enter but is also supported by tax payer money.

The suspect was so certain that the police would kill him, that he sent out his final words and thoughts to his loved ones indicating that his plan was 'suicide by cop' and unfortunately, his plan was successful. Even after the police decided on a gun control plan, nine days prior to the suspect's murder, the result was still the same but this time included the murder of one of their own. Citizens are being murdered by police for unnecessary reasons, and this is resulting to fear for all the people. Not the fear where you are doing something wrong and do not want to get caught, but the fear where you do not want to go outside because you might get shot. The police are there to make their city feel safe and protected and for the most part, they are the last ones people want to contact for help. Yes there are exceptions and I personally admire the police officers that do not take their job as a joke. But for the ones that terrorize and intimidate the people, should be faced with a punishment and not the ""paid-leave"" type. If the ""suicide by cop"" did not open the eyes of of a few officers then what else will it take for them to realize what they are doing is wrong? The statistics are there. This problem is preventable, so why is so hard to stop? ",-0.9954
236,"On a related note, it can be all to easy to dismiss ""anxiety"", ""nerves"", etc, but as we see here, people are tortured by systematically induced panic attacks via waterboarding, etc, (amplified by panic at the fear of future panic attacks).<br/><br/>The lack of scars, marks, obvious injury, etc is, of course a bonus when it comes to denying that people are being tortured.<br/><br/>The old phrase ""nervous breakdown"" has the breakdown part right, though it seems to me it often carries a shaming implication of weakness or some kind of character deficit.<br/><br/>It's a matter of administering enough of the right kind of abuse or ""traumatic stress"", especially if it reverberates with past abuse and creates a sense of hopelessness &amp; helplessness.<br/><br/>There's also a connection in there with PTSD. And it's also worth thinking about our prison system and what's likely to be going on the nervous systems of those turned back onto the streets at some point. There are those who say ""Good - they should be scared - scared straight."" But the fear response, fight-flight-freeze, puts ""fight"" up there in a prominent position for good reason.",-0.9969
237,"As commonly defined, terrorism is a tactic used by a group, not the act of a person acting alone. Roof is a race mass murderer, not a race terrorist.<br/><br/>Doesn't everyone remember how we mocked the Bush “War on Terrorism” because of (among other things) the meaninglessness of a war on a tactic? I believe that labeling as a terrorist Roof, who as far as we know was inspired by racist and terrorist groups but never joined one or was even in contact with one, is an instance of the same kind of error.<br/><br/>It was a hate crime, a race murder. Roof was clearly motivated by racist hate, was infected by racist discourse on the Internet and elsewhere, and was inspired by the acts of other race murderers and racially-oriented terrorist groups. But there is no reason to label his acts terrorism. Mass race murder is just as heinous as terrorism, but just because we have the same kind of emotional reaction to two events doesn't mean that they are equivalent.<br/><br/>Why does this matter?<br/><br/>Calling him a terrorist inflates his importance (he apparently didn't have sufficient people skills to be a real terrorist) and diminishes the importance of terrorism. As horrible as Roof's crimes were, they are not as dangerous to us as terrorism, which involves organized, sustained guerrilla action, normally against a State or other large institution, intended to terrorize a population in order to achieve the group's goals.",-0.9988
