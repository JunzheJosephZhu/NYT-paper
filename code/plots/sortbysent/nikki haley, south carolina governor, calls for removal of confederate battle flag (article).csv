0,"Old time Southerners know when the song, ""Dixie,"" was played at the end of every sporting event, from high school to college, and the great legions of fans from both Southern teams stood and at the conclusion let out a ""Rebel Yell.""<br/><br/>That ""heritage"" ended with integration. High schools and colleges quickly shelved the remainder of ""old times,"" in the light of the new day.<br/><br/>Now the time has come to do the same with a flag tainted by its own misuse even by those who claim it is a cherished symbol of heritage (albeit, seen through a very narrow lens!). The attempt to remove all actions and ideals and ideologies associated with the flag through its history has stripped it of meaning. And even its original heritage it taunted by those who deny it flew for the cause of slavery as a state right.<br/><br/>Through its denial, blame, and violence, its meaning was lost long ago. But would not those ancestors be proud of progress? Would they not be willing now to sacrifice for communities of love and healing, without race as a division of power and opportunity? If so, wouldn't they want the old flag to come down, as ""Dixie"" did? Wouldn't they want to honor the progress we have all made since its time? As men of honor, surely would this be so. Let's honor them by taking the flag down on public grounds!",0.9903
1,"There wasn't anything ""civil"" about the 1861 War for Southern Independence. The South had no option but to defend itself from the yankee invaders who were determined to protect their economic interests. They were not about to lose their ""milch cow"". It was NOT about slavery. Millions of southern men didn't go to war over an issue that only affected 6 percent of the population. That is absurd.   The truth is - there wasn't any shining northern force fighting a moral battle for the sake of ending slavery AND there was no oppressive southern force fighting to preserve it either. <br/><br/>The war that continues today is over POWER, greed and economic interests. Perhaps it is time to separate into two countries - one that cherishes ONE NATION UNDER GOD with a clear understanding of the constitution stating  the rights of the PEOPLE and STATES comes BEFORE the government. Without the South, the northern country can accelerate secularism, bigger government and socialism.    ",0.9788

3,"Unlike the secessionist traitors of the Confederate States of America, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson led a United States of America. The fact that they were both white supremacist misogynist slave masters engaged in native genocide is the founding American ideal principle.<br/><br/>How about identifying the Democratic Party ideal with the likes of John  Brown, Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman,  King Phillip aka Metacomet of the Wampanoag, Tecumseh of the Shawnee and Ocanastota of the Cherokee?",0.9618
4,"It has not ended and indeed Southern ideology has been the big winner since it captured the Republican Party and banished liberal Republicans.<br/><br/>Red vs Blue..............sort of says it all.<br/><br/>Even so,  we are one nation with the freedom to vigorously disagree.<br/><br/>We are still the envy of the planet.<br/><br/>We could stand to be a bit more respectful and gentle with one another.

6,"Defenders of the Lost Cause defend the public flying of their flag because it's all they've got. The wealth, the economic success, the great houses of the South were based upon one thing - the enslavement of their fellow man. Once that was lost, the South collapsed like a pricked bubble because there was nothing else left to sustain it.<br/><br/>Those who talk glowingly today about Southern chivalry and Southern honour, about the Ante-Bellum era, those who weep for the lost grandeur of the South, are little different from the ageing grandchildren of the senior Nazis who secretly still come together commemorate the glory days of the Third Reich. Or to those who nostalgically raise a toast to Stalin and Lenin, to Mussolini and to Franco.<br/><br/>I grew up with many such folks. Over time, I have learned to recognise them and to call them what they are. They are not conservatives. Rather, they are first and foremost fascists, who will believe to their dying day in the supremacy over reason and over science of the iron fist in the velvet glove, and who believe that someone with a white skin, whatever their faults, must be inherently superior to a human with a black one whatever their merits.",0.9393
7,"Hey Southerners - those of you reacting so strongly on this issue - do you think that everyone who wants to see the end of that flag also wants you to throw away all the other aspects of your culture and heritage, including the love of liberty and independence? I think it’s just the racist part of it that most reasonable people want to see you fess up to and let go of.<br/>Those out there who don’t see that there’s SO much more to Southern culture than just the history of slavery, and the overlooking or acceptance of it, are probably those ‘liberals’ you all don’t like, and a pox on them.<br/>But if you think that getting rid of that symbol ‘removes’ such a significant part of who you are, then y’all are just agreeing with them, aren’t you?<br/>And while I can also well understand how much you don’t like having outsiders/Northerners tell you what you should do, where else is it going to come from? Obviously not from yourselves – been that way for a long, long time.",0.9318
8,"Having lived through many ""pivotal"" events in America, often having to do with race, I am witnessing another.  When the son of Strom Thurmond says he is not proud of ""this heritage,"" that is meaningful to me.  I remember his father well.  He personified that heritage.  I do not expect an abrupt about-face.  Racial attitudes are strongly held and a process of enlightenment will be lengthy.  Yet what is happening in just a few days is hopeful.  Senator Thurmond also included in his remarks that human beings were kept against their will while experiencing unimaginable acts.   Once the flags and other symbols fall, it's the human beings that need our concern.  I hope that those whose devotion to a flag has fallen can invest their devotion in them.  ",0.9126
9,"That is certainly one way of looking at the 3/5 compromise, although not the one most historians adopt.  Since slaves did not form part of the community in the south (they were property), counting them at all gave the south more political power than democratic principles would have granted it.  Women throughout the country also could not vote, but they did comprise part of the community in that men in a sense represented them.  (I am not justifying this, merely describing the way the system worked.)  Nobody represented African-Americans, slave or free (except in those few northern states that enfranchised free blacks).",0.9116
10,"While it is true that the country was founded on Enlightenment ideals, at least two of the founders...Washington and Jefferson...became presidents, and both were slave owners.<br/><br/>Therefore, though they had Enlightenment ideals, they had slave-owner mentalities. In other words, much as we may want to idealize the Founding Fathers, there is that stain of corruption...their belief in the legitimacy of slavery.<br/><br/>In defense of Washington, he did free his slaves, Jefferson did not, and even illegitimately fathered children with one of them. <br/><br/>When it came to the appeal of having slaves, some Enlightenment ideals went out the window.",0.91
11,"And its mental illness to keep perpetuating these arguments; its not a flag that killed these people, no but the ideals that flag represents killed those people, racism.<br/><br/>Guns don't kill people do, yet its SC easy gun access laws that have long been documented flooding their State and NYS with cheap effective killing machines.  <br/><br/>As opposed to other products, guns are the only product specifically designed to kill, with the worst offending classes designed to kill people with the least amount of effort, quickly and efficiently.  In this case a handgun which in NYS/NYC you better have ""justifiable cause"" even to get a permit to own one.<br/><br/>Cry mental health Tomas I agree with you but modern sensible gun laws made a difference, this 21 year boy was a known criminal and some how got easy access to a legal gun?<br/><br/>As a Northerner I find the Stars and Bars offensive not just because of racism, but my ancestry went down into the South, killed the soldiers, burn their homes, crops, and cities, freed their slaves and utterly destroyed their sinful way of life.  They paid that bill in sweat, tears and blood, their blood against no good treasonous ""gentlemen"" living in a ""particular institution"", racial slavery.<br/><br/>That flag hanging over the SC's capital grounds is nothing more a giant F/U to the US, and the memory of thousands of Blue Shirt members of the Grand Old Army of the Republic that gave their less full measure of devotion so we all can live a better life in 2015.

13,"This is so silly.  NO, it's downright objectionable.  Political Correctness to the dumbest degree.  Jefferson was the prime author of our Constitution, for heaven's sake.  Slavery was an abomination.  As was child labor.  And many other things, some of which are still going on.  Instead of displacing those who had an important place in our history for being persons of their times, who embraced values that today are discredited: instead of this, why don't we stop heaping esteem and public honor on people alive today, who are, as we speak, dishonoring our national values of equal justice under the law, integrity, etc.  I refer to the bankers and financiers and film stars and athletes and former presidents who dishonor every possible personal code of honor, yet are given places of honor at every public table.  Trying to remove Jefferson from his historical place of honor is so wrong. ",0.8853

15,"There was nothing civil about the mass treason that occurred when the Confederate leaders tried to make off with US territory and federal installations; an act of war on the United States that constituted treason.<br/><br/>To say it wasn't about slavery ignores that the 1860 election, which prompted the secession, was about the expansion of slavery and that some southern states explicitly mentioned the defense of slavery in their secession declarations.  Further, as the war developed, the Union effort did become about the elimination of slavery.",0.8645

21,"The battle of ""liberty and justice for all"" - or in Lincoln's words ""new birth of freedom"" and ""government of the people, by the people and for the people"" - that's to say, democracy, is never simply a fait accompli, accomplished once at for all.  Rather it is an ongoing struggle as the spirit of slavery's oppression and dehumanization takes new, often subtler, natural-seeming forms.<br/><br/>The aptest description of today's counterpart of the antebellum South's whips and chains I recall seeing was a casual reader's comment in the Times on contemporary economic conditions. He called the plight of many insecure, brutalized and choiceless workers (at a whole range of pay levels, from sub-minimum wage to nominally 'middle class') ""free range slavery.""  <br/><br/>The Oppression and brutalization of slavery can coexist with the kinds of merely nominal freedom today's economic conditions entail for so many.  Many today are still under slave conditions, with nearly meaningless token elements of freedom.",0.7783
22,"Ahhh...the hypocrisy of the NY Times and its rabid base of well intentioned liberals.

23,"While I respect your service to our country, your comment rolls into a neat package all that is wrong with the logic and thinking of those who still want to fly such an obvious symbol of hate and racism.<br/><br/>In one fell swoop, you've conjoined God, the United States and the CSA. What the CSA represented--treason in the name of enslaving other humans--is the greatest disgrace to God ever put forth in this country. That part of our history can never be erased, and we definitely should not be glorifying it by flying that flag on any public property.",0.7596
24,"An easy change that will make everyone feel like they've made progress but will actually accomplish nothing.  I don't know why we constantly think that ridding ourselves of a symbol or a word will have any impact on the thought or behavior associated with it.

30,"I preface my statements by stating live in San Francisco, but have frequented the Deep South for years to visit family and vacation.<br/><br/>That said, I covered Antebellum through Reconstruction in my secondary and collegiate history courses, but I have not been able to reconcile America's historic willingness to fight any enemy of the state (foreign or domestic) for sake of preserving 'The Union' with America's allowance of formerly rebellious, some would argue traitorous, states to to maintain the symbol of that very treachery in their state capitals.<br/><br/>I don't equate our nation's odd acceptance of the Confederate flag to a hypothetical German acceptance of Nazi symbolism because the Third Reich independently controlled the governmental structure in Germany for years. Plainly put they won. It is perfectly sensible and consistent in history that a country's new regime will not openly accept the symbolism of past regimes on government property.  <br/><br/>America's past is different, the 7 (later 11) internationally unrecognized Confederate States tried to secede and were eventually defeated without the United States of America changing regimes or political order, we won.  Western Pennsylvanians don't and shouldn't insist symbolism of the Whiskey Rebellion fly over Harrisburg as a reminder of their 1790s struggle for independence. Similarly, why we as indivisible Americans allow state capitals of formerly traitorous states to promote symbolism of their former treachery is unbeknownst to me.",0.5684

36,"If we examine what the Republican Party believes in it is quite similar to what the Confederacy believed in: from states rights versus federalism to maintaining the plantation mentality; i.e. a large undereducated labor force - to do the dirty work, and a small group of power brokers that call the shots. This explains why the Republican Party is against raising the minimum wage, against welfare, against the ACA, and against unions. It also explains why they believe that less taxes for the rich will somehow trickle down to the poor, the workers. It explains why corporations like slave owners should have the authority to determine wage, equal or unequal pay for equal work, who gets educated and who can't afford it and who gets health care and who pays. So, the Confederate flag is really a symbol that the south intends to rise again and reclaim the values they fought and died for 150 years ago.",0.4588

And by the way, what makes you think South Carolina would even PERMIT an actual vote, really.

The federal government, in the minds of the political elite, represented either a valuable asset to protect and expand the institution or a deadly enemy of it, depending on who ruled in Washington.  Southern attitudes on almost all national issues ultimately reflected the need to shield slavery from hostile groups in the north.  While racism still distorts politics in the south (and elsewhere), a more conventional variety of conservatism really holds sway here.  Republican dominance in the south resembles GOP control of western states.  Southern businessmen dislike federal regulations that threaten their profits, and evangelicals oppose a social liberalism that challenges their religious values.

162,"Mike, I agree with the general point you are making: slavery as an institution developed over time and this development was intricately tied to the racialization of what had been a broader system of indenture. <br/><br/>The problem with your major point, not minor at all, is that for all the expansion of slavery in the south, the north cannot be held blameless. In fact, Massachusetts was importing slaves and treating them as such by the 1640s, was two decades before the full ""legalization"" of racial slavery in Virginia. Often in these early years, Boston ships carried captured Amerindians to the Caribbean where they were enslaved in exchange for African, Carib Amerindians, or mixed race slaves who were sent back to New England and Virginia as labor.<br/><br/>I regret to say I know all this in part because many of my 17th Century ancestors in MA and RI were involved in the trade. Yes, ultimately slavery became much more an on-the-groud issue in the South than in the North, but neither was blameless. This is the point Lincoln was making in his second inaugural address.  <br/><br/>Certainly, I wish southerners had not expanded slavery and had not come to justify the institution with rabid white supremacy. I wish some of my southern ancestors had not held slaves. I really bemoan the fact that my new England ancestors were instrumental in the early slave trade.

At that time the notion that slavery would be limited to those of African descendent became popular along with the notion that those of African descendent were predisposed to live as servants and dependent upon the superior people of European descendent. That core belief was part of the justification for the Confederate states to leave the Union when it became clear that eventually the Federal government would outlaw slavery.

The well-intentioned, non-bigoted Southerner sees the flag as a symbol of the ""good things"" about the region and/or era (and there are many). The stark reality, however, is that group is the overwhelming minority and the fight for the flag's meaning was won long ago by the small but visible group of racist bigots.

As someone from the South, this issue is not new to me, as I have heard numerous discussions on whether this flag should be removed because of what the people who created that flag were fighting for. Up until the church shooting, to me it was unclear whether the flag was simply a racist symbol, or if it was a representation of this country’s.

So, why now, after the church shooting is this issue more prominent in South Carolina?It is because the murderer of those nine African American people viewed the flag in a sickening way, in a way that made his racist actions more justifiable to him.
