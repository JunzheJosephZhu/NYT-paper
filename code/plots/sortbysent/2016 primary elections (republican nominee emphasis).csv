0,"Thanks to President Obama -- millions of people now have healthcare who didn't.  It will be part of his legacy that he was the President who like Lyndon Johnson with Medicare and the Voting Rights Act and FDR and the introduction of Social Security -- did the most to help the majority of Americans who are not part of the 1% and never will be.   Three great Presidents, three great Americans who did the ""right thing.""<br/><br/>The names of the three ""justices"" who voted against should be emblazoned on the list of American scoundrels: Scalia, his toady Thomas, and Alito -- the day that all of them bite the dust and are off the court will be a great day.",0.9722
1,"He has been able to do great work, with great humility and grace, after he left the grueling and nasty work he had to do as president.  We still should honor him for the Dayton accord; his presence on the world stage; his unusual and original work on climate change and the emphasis on that issue even in his early presidency.  I totally understand how former presidents can make and do make a difference in the world.  For the life of me, I have not seen anything from the last three GOP presidents that would make me proud.  W. of course, needs to keep out of the public eye, and I think he understands that, although he does have a very good record on AIDS work in Africa.  Somehow I don't believe the GOP would like to make that point.  Reagan had Alzheimer, and frankly, nothing stands out about GW.  ",0.967
2,"Mr. Ramsey only included part of the President's statement during that panel:<br/><br/>""And that is not something that -- for me to have that conversation [about parenting] does not negate my conversation about the need for early childhood education, or the need for job training, or the need for greater investment in infrastructure, or jobs in low-income communities. <br/><br/>So I’ll talk till you're blue in the face about hard-nosed, economic macroeconomic policies, but in the meantime I’ve got a bunch of kids right now who are graduating, and I want to give them some sense that they can have an impact on their immediate circumstances, and the joys of fatherhood.""<br/><br/>Obama is right on the money. There's society, and the individual. Mr. Obama is not blaming black Americans. He is saying he will work on the macro side for justice, but that each of us has a responsibility to live in such away that advances justice in our personal sphere. That seems entirely correct and reasonable to me. ",0.9645
3,"I listened to President Obama's speech. He has a well laid out arguments for my California senators to support.  I would write to them to support.  Also, in my opinion president earned his Noble peace prize if he succeeds in implementing the agreement",0.9638
4,"What I find interesting is the extent to which Jeb is using the some of the same strategies as his bother and father. Why not? It worked for them. Emphasize the supposed ""compassion"" in conservatism. Claim to be a ""uniter"". Present oneself as sympathetic to issues of people from the Spanish-speaking Western Hemisphere. Maybe Jeb speaks Spanish, but the Bush's sure did lie about George speaking Spanish. Claim that the candidate was an amazing governor. Remember how George was this great education governor? The press didn't bother to vet out the true on that until after George was elected. The policies with Jeb will be the same policies the Republicans have been peddling for many years. Always cut taxes on upper income no matter what. Always support unrestrained spending on the military. Turn regulatory agencies into subsidiaries of the industries they regulate. And, of course, Tora, Tora, Tora!",0.9626
5,"I heard Pres. Carter speak once at the Carter Center and was impressed with his humor, intelligence, and humility.  We were fortunate to have him as president and his accomplishments including the Camp David accord, emphasis on energy and the environment, as well as the Panama Canal treaty and SALT.  The successful negotiations to release the Iranian hostages were by Pres. Carter and his administration although the actual release followed Reagan's inauguration.  No Reagan officials participated in the negotiations which were virtually complete by his administration.<br/><br/>Pres. Carter is a very fine man, and one whom I suspect is close to a living saint, especially for his dedication to peace, the eradication of disease in Africa, and democracy itself.",0.9606
6,"Legacy indeed:  ""My administration will be the most transparent in history.""  Trade deal drafted in secret.  Muslim video responsible for 9/11 Bengazi.  If you like your doctor and health insurance you can keep it.  The private sector is doing just fine, and after all, they didn't build that business, someone else made that happen.  Declining working class income.  Record numbers on public assistance.  Incredible gains in wealth for the super rich.  A make believe economy run by the FED.  If I had a son, he would look like Trayvon.  Desperate Americans cling to their guns and religion.  Barry, the most divisive leader in US history.  They are coming for capitalism next...",0.9578
7,"JAP,<br/>I do agree with you about the Syria blunder, not the ""redline,"" but saying that Assad must go. Also he was wrong in participating in the Libya bombing campaign. Both were horrible.<br/><br/>But I am an admirer and ardent supporter of president Obama. I'm sure he regrets it. I wish he apologized to the Syrians. The Benghazi  incident is a Republican creation, in search of a scandal. There's nothing in it.<br/><br/>The Iran nuclear agreement is also a big deal, may even be as large as ""Obamacare."" In the large scheme of things, Obama will be seen as a transformational president. I hope, just a hope, not an expectation, his presidency will reverse the disastrous Reagan revolution.",0.9568
8,"My first presidential vote went to Jimmy Carter solely on his promise - which he kept - to pardon all the Vietnam War draft refusers. Far beyond that, what this nation got was not only promises kept but a man whose honesty, conviction, faith and selflessness has done every American proud and set an example I wish was the standard for our society. ",0.9428
9,"Jeb needs to play to his own strengths and act like Trump is not barrelling all over him.  He is a seemingly nice guy who was governor and should be a lock ovote.  Trump is defying gravity - things that would destroy lesser men, like offending important demographics like women or people from Mexico, work to his advantage and that is because everyone already knows all his flaws but they aren't' so sure about everyone else.  Better the devil you know.  He is also easy to understand - I am bringing back the American Dream, big time - instead of droning on about real-world policy issues like the real politicians.  It's hard to explain real policy in the Twitterverse and people these days have a short attention span.  Some snappy policy slogans and confidence might help the rest of them.",0.9407
10,"There are many things that I disagree with that the Republican Party is promoting. However, if they supported legitimate candidates, rather than people such as Scott Walker I'd be happy to listen to them. There are so many issues with Walker, his interesting college career, his failure to alert the voting public to Act 10 before the election, his chummy call with the purported Koch brother, the John Doe investigations, his staff going to jail, the latest WEDC issues, that when people say he's our man I have to think there are no standards in their party. Just because thus guy likes picking fights, doesn't mean that he us a competent executive. The world is a complicated place, and this guy is not up to it. And as for his handlers in Wisconsin, I'm glad they are being exposed. As one previous commenter stated, Wisconsin voted for Joseph McCarthy too.",0.93
11,"A great man all around. I can't think of anyone more selfless than President Carter who has given his life to service, not just here but across the world. <br/><br/>I wish him the best while he goes through these difficult days. Hang in there Mr. Carter. We are grateful for your service and our thoughts are with you. ",0.928
12,"Jonathan , did you read the article? Like where it says ""Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in January to rename the peak, but Ohio lawmakers sought to block the move"".<br/>You think the people of Alaska should decide this? Well, it's pretty clear what they want to call the mountain, but the politicians from Ohio think it is their property. Good thing Obama used his lawful power to straighten this out",0.9235
13,"Spot on, Mr. Ramsey. I thought the genius of Obama's Pinckney eulogy was that it was heartfelt, strong, and didn't seem to cater to America's mainstream anti-blackness while also not offending the mainstream if the top comments here are a good barometer. As the first black president, I doubt there is anyone else alive who knows how to accomplish this in 2015 better than Obama does.<br/><br/>I would like to have the feeling that this was possible because we are the ones changing rather than the President. I want to think that, at the very least, we are becoming okay with the perspective of black people as people. Maybe we are slowly getting there, but when I read so many popular comments angry about your opinion which had the gall to praise Obama for finally showing (or being allowed to show!) some unalloyed empathy for black people in a major speech, it's disheartening.",0.9226
14,"I so wish that lfkl's (los angeles) succinct and relevant message (""We have a great president.[because}..........Thank you Mr. President."") was the universal topic of conversation instead of all the knee-jerk, uninformed Republican responses to the accord reached by Iran, the U.S., and five other nations.  I often wonder when a significant number of Americans and their media will elevate their thought processes and communications to respectable levels.",0.9099
15,"President Carter, my heartfelt thanks for your service to our country and to humanity. You are the very first president I voted for as a young man, and I am proud to have done so.  The world is a better place because of you.",0.9081
16,"Scott Walker is an incredibly smart administrator, and most importantly he truly gets the plight of the average American in the middle class who has been hammered by this administration. When he is president Americans will breathe a sigh of relief to return to normal. ",0.899
17,"One fact explains a great deal--Though a successful and wealthy business leader, he will get little support from Wall Street or many corporate leaders.  In fact, many of them seem to be in Bush's corner. One even gets the sense these folks fear Trump. Could some of the reason be their belief that Trump, who knows many of them them well, might not be as reliably in their service as Bush and others would?",0.8935
18,"If you think the SCOTUS decision in 2000 was a ""coup d'etat"", you either grossly misunderstood it or were too young to know what was going on.<br/><br/>They did not appoint Bush President. They simply stopped the recount in Florida. Now I personally disagree with SCOTUS on this -- I though a recount in the event of a near-tie was fair. But they did not.<br/><br/>However: AFTER the election, this very publication and others did their own (non binding) count of the votes -- and Bush won, albeit by a very small margin. So had SCOTUS ruled different, the recount would have proceeded -- and Bush STILL WOULD HAVE WON. <br/><br/>That hardly makes SCOTUS actions a coup d'etat. And the results would have been the same anyways.",0.8873
19,"IN 2010, Ohio republicans gained the governor's mansion and the legislature.  Like Wisconsin, they passed a similar right to work law and Gov. Kasich signed it into law.  This all happened within weeks of taking office. Unlike Wisconsin, instead of trying to recall the governor, Ohioans forced the legislation, not the governor, onto the ballot.  In the ensuing special election, the whole law was voted down in an overwhelming landslide.  In hindsight, the Wisconsin democratic party erred in going after recall.  Recalls, historically, are  rare and also rarely successful.  Had Wisconsin Democrats followed Ohio's method It is likely they would have also got rid of the law through the ballot box and denied Gov. Walker his great shining achievement.    Next time, they'll know better.  One would hope. ",0.8867
20,"In a world that is constantly changing, what could be more reassuring than to have another Bush? As the country looks back in nostalgic reverie at an idealized past, thought lost forever, hope appears in the person of Jeb! Hahaha",0.883
21,"Electable does not equal excellence.  Ronald Reagan can be admired, if you must for bringing the Republican Party back to the presidency, but nothing he did or any of his party's successors have done anything that is truly supportive of the working and middle class.  ",0.8794
22,JFK and Jimmy Carter were both brilliant presidents' JFK for his grasp on reality and Carter for his honesty. Carter was just too transparent for the politicians to handle. He deserves our respect.,0.8779
23,"Well, I've read this script before with the NSA bill. First, the Congress scuttles an aspect of an important bill to demonstrate resolve to interest groups. Then a few days later, as media attention turns to other things, the Congress passes the same bill with little fanfare. Obama is capable of taking a short-term hit to his prestige as long as he ultimately prevails. Wait and see... ",0.8779
24,"Joe Biden's integrity, humor and frankness is precisely what America needs. We are on the edge of a new unsettled global reality born of climate change, resource depletion and reactionary movements. We're facing it with aged and eroding material infrastructure, a sclerotic economy and a rudderless bipartisan political establishment.  <br/><br/>Regurgitating yesterday's corrupt and failed leadership be it Bush or Clinton is hardly the answer. What's needed today is a progressive and inclusive vision of America's future in this new reality and someone who can clearly articulate the way forward. We haven't had that since the JFK/LBJ years. Joe Biden offers our best hope for the kind of transformational leadership many of us expected after 2008. ",0.872
25,"That sounds like a great article, so long as in includes evertyhing Clinton has said, contrasted against the actual facts at hand.",0.8689
26,"So it's still Bush's fault?  Sorry, and I'm not a fan of Bush, but the Arab Spring spawned this nightmare and Obama was the cheer leader of the Arab Spring.  He naively thought it was about democracy and freedom.  Guess he doesn't really understand Islam.",0.868
27,"Beautifully written and right on.<br/>We are certainly going to miss Mr. Obama as president, but sure he will continue to work for equality for all the peoples of the U.S. after he leaves office. He will be able to act in ways unfettered with the anchors of Congress and public discourse and we'll all be better off for it.",0.8608
28,"Ray, do you remember the Kennedy brothers? I'd say they came from a pretty privileged background, and they turned out OK.",0.8415
29,"I have to say that calling him Piyush like so many commentators are is no different or less vile than those who chose to emphasize Barack Obama's middle name each time he ran. He wants to be called Bobby, like James Carter wants to be called Jimmy and  John Ellis Bush wants to be called Jeb, and that's his choice and we should respect it. America is the country or reinvention. If I had a nickel for every jew, Italian, Croat or whomever who Americanized one or more of their names I would be rich. I do not like Jindal one bit but if he wants me to call him Bobby, I can respect at least that.",0.8292
30,"the only worry Bush has is that some other yahoo running for President will promise 5% growth.  Clearly he doesn't care whether his target it true or not, its just a ""promise"" to offer that his voters can then use to explain to themselves and others why they are voting for Bush.  ""What this country needs is growth!"" they'll say, ignoring the fact that all the gains of the past 30 years have gone to the top 1% (probably since they don't understand enough about economics to realize that, any more than they understand the blatant falsity of a 4% growth rate).",0.8055

33,The person Howard Schultz describes is Bernie Sanders. He certainly did not go into politics to make a lot of money. He is a true public servant very much like Franklin Delano Roosevelt.,0.7893
34,"John Ellis Bush, like Alice in Wonderland, must be trying to believe six impossible things before breakfast. (1) Barack Obama and Donald Trump are identical twins who think exactly alike. (2) Not mentioning his interference with the process of recounting Presidential election votes means no one will ever ask him about it (3) The wishful thinking of evangelicals was more accurate than the actual doctors' diagnosis of brain-dead Terri Schiavo (4) The state, Federal and Supreme Court rulings that his invasion of the Schiavo household was unconstitutional can be safely ignored. (5) Obamacare, which is succeeding, can be replaced by an Apple Watch, which is flopping. (6) If you don't say Bush, no one will think Bush. ",0.7783
35,"And Nixon was the last president to propose and draw up a plan for universal health care.   It probably would have suffered the same problems as the ACA, but at least he was thinking and caring.

38,"Say what you want about Chris Chrstie but I cannot forget how acted after the hurricane Sandy.<br/>I saw his press conferences, I saw the way talked. He put everybody at ease, he put hope in my heart.<br/>Then he put aside all the party differences, and met with Obama (right before the elections). He didn't care that he's going to be accused of helping Obama to get reelected, he didn't care that Republican would hate that.<br/>He asked Obama for help and he received it. New Jersey needed that help  badly. He did it for the state, not for himself. He was very gracious.<br/>I'm a Democrat but I think he's a good guy. I believe him.",0.7694

Oh yes, she was kept out of the President's hair for four years. Small price to pay to keep the Clintons outside the Beltway.",0.7579
41,"Matt, your comments are spot-on and I confess that this took me by surprise in 2000. The economic picture back then should have paved the way to an easy win for Gore, and the fact that it didn't shows that Gore was a weak candidate (couldn't even win his home state) and/or ran a very poor campaign (didn't enlist Clinton's support nearly enough, which probably cost him Arkansas and at least some of the other states you mentioned too). It is true that he was victimized by Nader (who got far more votes in Florida and New Hampshire than Gore's margin of defeat in either state) and by plain-old bad luck (remember the ""Palm Beach Jews for Buchanan"" fiasco?), but it was Gore's deficiencies that let it come to all that in the first place. It's frustrating to me because Gore should have won that year and would have been a better president than George W. Bush.",0.7449
42,"Sorry! Christie is right. He wasn't discussed in the news everyday as being accountable. The news reporting on the ""Bridgegate"" matter implied for months that he would be found responsible. All the democrats who are whining about Hillary being unfairly treated with respect to Benghazi relished in their comments about Christie. But at least the Governor, who isn't privy to highly sensitive federal government and foreign policy information, didn't decide to use personal emails for government matters and then decide which ones to wipe clean. ",0.7304
43,"In answer to your last question about Obama and Hillary:  I voted for Obama in the last election because I was impressed by his apparent sincerity and leadership.  However, it appears he has given up dealing with Congress and is now more interested in appearing on talk shows.  As to Hillary, she could not handle being Secretary of State.  Someone should inform her that it takes more than bleaching your hair blond to qualify as a presidential nominee.",0.7264
44,"Well, unfortunately,  Cruz wants to quadruple h-1bs;   Hillary is bought and sold by the corproations lining her pocket.<br/><br/>Not sure about Perry;   Jeb Bush is a sellout and Marco Rubio was one of the Gang of 8 that wanted amnesty for 20+ million illegals.  <br/><br/>Santorium seems to be good on the issue as well as the Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker",0.7184
45,"Seems to me that Bush III has only one plan and that is to get into the White House to feed his cronies.<br/>And that is more than a success plan, that is what already worked two times over.<br/><br/>Or to quote Forrest Gump:<br/><br/>""Dumb is what dumb does""<br/><br/>Which has obviously never been an obstacle in the Bush family to win seats as long as they have been supported by the right folks of the Cheney, Rumsfeld, Koch Brothers and other clans of the Republicans.<br/><br/>Obama is a catastrophe in progress, but wait till you see the next Bush administration.<br/><br/>Be happy, it could have been worse, so I was happy and it came worse.",0.7135
46,"The Republican party philosophical leadership fell off of a cliff years ago on every issue that matters.  Why, they have been taken over by anti intellectual 17th century religious fanatics such as those who founded the Massachusetts Colony.   <br/><br/>Sensible people like Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Bob Dole, Bush41 have no place in the modern GOP.  Heck - Bush43 might not make the cut.",0.7108
47,"There is a great deal of similarity between President Carter and Bernie Sanders. Both are fundamentally honest men who speak the truth even when no one wants to hear it. President Carter told Americans to turn down the thermostat, put on sweaters, and drive less during the oil crisis, and he was crucified for it. No candidate or president since has dared speak about shared sacrifice to the American public. Mr. Sanders as well does not pull any punches - and the New York Times vilifies him for it. Both men have little energy for pretense - what you see with them is what you get. And both have always stood up for ordinary people, and worked against injustice. For that I applaud them both.",0.701
48,"Walker calls himself conservative while chopping away at an institution whose roots go back to the 13th century. If you happened to go to a good school and were made to study Marx, you would recognize what is going on in Wisconsin.

61,"RE Daniel Friedman's remarks about how difficult it would be for the GOP to spin its mistakes in 2016 because, in part, of the ""Bush Cheney war,""he should be reminded that w/o Dem. Party support, not once but twice, the authorization to use force in Iraq never would have been put through. OBAMA promised to end the war, and almost 8 years into his presidency, we are still there, and contemplating even increasing our involvement. Likewise for Guantanamo, which Obama pledged to close, and surprise, we r still there. I believe it was the late George Wallace--who was considered a liberal by the Alabama standards of the 1950's-- who said there was not ""a dime's worth of difference between the two parties!"" Given GOP support for the TPP, without which Obama's pet bill never would have passed, was not GW right on the money? One thing that has changed is the increased marginalization of ""little whites.""By the time Obama's term comes to an end, the cultural cleansing of this socio-economic class will perhaps be complete! Maybe that's what Mr Friedman wants. Obama himself set the tone when, in a fund raising event in 2007 before wealthy contributors in Pacific Heights, the future President spoke condescendingly of the white working class as being ""anti immigrant, attached to their guns and their bibles.""

Christie and his political hack cronies on the Port Authority have decided to undertake a never before tried feat of engineering, raising the deck of the Bayonne Bridge.

They do not understand that the pain they feel today was brought on by the mistaken policies of 2001.
