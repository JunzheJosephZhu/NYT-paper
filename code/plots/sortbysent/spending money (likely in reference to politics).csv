Obviously your intention is for these items to find users, who would not need to pay for them, for these item to e still useful rather than thrown in the trash and to be used and enjoyed by those who like them, but may not have time the means to buy them. But, your  intention is not to make a financial profit. Therefore your friend's action of taking advantage of your honorable intention and turning  your genres gesture into a commercial profit venture for herself is not honorable nor decent, therefore not ethical. This is not a high principled person and your instinct is right. Best not to leave more items or share them with her, but directly donate to those in need. ",0.9902
1,"Thanks for reminding us.  One good turn deserves another, so let me remind you about the willingness of SOME scientists to be complicit in tobacco companies' efforts to hide the dangers of their products.  It's not that all private funding corrupts the scientific efforts, but the public is robbed of their ability to judge for themselves whether or not they trust the source of this information because the research group in this article ""forgot"" disclose a donor with an unquestionable conflict of interest.  Not only that, the same research group's findings just happened to be advantageous to that same undisclosed donor's pecuniary interests.  Finally, the disclosure might NEVER have happened if light had not been for exposure (i.e., the cat is out of the bag).  We wouldn't be having this discussion if Microsoft secretly donated money to research the causes of obesity and it happened to benefit Coca-Cola, but that's not the case, now is it?  This is more like Exxon donating to a research group that just happens to publish a study indicating that crude oil is actually more beneficial to marine life than most people think!  It's fine for them to donate, but you'd best be transparent right from the beginning about such conflicts of interest if you want to be taken seriously.",0.9733
2,"I think what DRS is saying is, ""I worked hard and made something of myself... and those jerks can now steal my money for health care they're too lazy to afford on their own.""<br/>  Some are lazy. Some not. The proportion of lazy poor to poor is probably about the same as the proportion of avaricious rich to rich. Some of ACA beneficiaries have congenital conditions. Some had very productive lives until the cancer (or whatever) started beating them with a large stick. Some are making something of themselves in ways that don't make large incomes.<br/>  When government helps individuals, there's always outrage from some. But our money supports a lonely highway in Wyoming that sees 10,000 sets of tires a year. No benefit to me. Our money supported research that didn't work out. That scientist ate on my dime and produced nothing! A hurricane of our money blows into the military. Why punish me to protect Okinawa? Our money goes a million places providing no that benefit for me, yet somehow it's especially offensive when the money goes to feed, clothe, shelter, and yes provide health care for some people less fortunate than me.<br/>  A preacher I used to play racquetball with told this story about trying to get relief funds. A particularly successful church member said, ""I've worked hard for my success. I work hard every day."" The preacher answered, ""Do you think the woman in Uganda who walks seven miles every day to get water for her family is not working hard?""",0.9698

5,"I encourage everyone to read Dr. Tober's article. It is fascinating but limited in scope. If you read my book, you will see that one of the things that amazed me was how different the Iranians treated the ideas of ""selling"" or donating a kidney from one province to another. Shiraz, where Dr. Tober did her research is a province in Iran that has never implemented the national policy of allowing recipients to ""buy"" kidneys. It was always the convention of the Shiraz medical community that there was no buying or selling going on there -- Only compensating donors for their expenses. Now, in Shiraz, living donors are not even given enough to cover their expenses but only the small token gift from the national government.  Dr. Tober's insights are worth reviewing, but it is also worth noting that my book explores those regions where the legal sale -- or the national policy of allowing compensation for donation is implemented (e.g. Tehran)  AND I also explore regions that have taken a different approach to compensating donors -- namely Isfahan and Mashhad where donors are given a set payment to cover expenses and then other types of material benefits other than money. Tehran does some of this as well, but their general approach is a regulated market approach, while Isfahan and Mashhad have a social service approach. To understand more of what I mean by this watch my TEDMED or, if you can, read my book.",0.9578

14,"The first month I invested in a 401K I took the advice of experts and put the money into a T Rowe Price index fund.  It lost 6%.  It was MY 6% and I am adverse to losing money so I immediately put all my money into the safest U.S. treasuries fund TRP had.  True, I didn't make BIG returns and, true, the esteemed George Bush, Jr. and friends used MY money to bail out the banks when it all crashed, but I did not lose a dime.  I have kept it there and have never lost a dime.  Most of my friends and acquaintances lost one-half the value of their homes and 401Ks and, regardless of what the experts say, they lost it to the top 1% global financial elite who control it all.
