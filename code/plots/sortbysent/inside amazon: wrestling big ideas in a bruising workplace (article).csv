0,"DM, I get what you are saying.  But I think the dynamics for the US economy have so changed that this sharing of resources is not going to happen.  ""Good jobs"" are being outsourced and swallowed up by technology.  OK, then, another solution is a gradual, voluntary decline in the birth rate, which will allow families to better share their resources and perhaps bring the number of young people more in line with the number of ""good jobs. What will most help the current group of collegians is a gradually increasing understanding of this dilemma and taking some protective measures.  First, academics are more important than sports and other activities, so don't fill the day up with both. Get the academics down, and regard the rest as hobby activities.  Second, remember that a good college experience is pretty much the same in most schools. They all try to offer majors, programs, and fun activities. So, don't go into huge debt financially, and don't fill your life with activities to get into a ""dream school"" that exists mostly in your head.  And finally, be realistic about work.  It's unlikely that a job will fulfill all your fantasies.  It's work, not paradise (most of the freelancers writing for online magazines about their perfect jobs have spouses with regular jobs).  And develop some interests that don't contribute to your resume!  Because ... you like doing them.",0.9956
1,"Mr. Campbell, you seem to miss the point.  Professor Ton is not trying to convince companies to become more socially conscious but to gain a better understanding of the true source of their profits.  Businesses that treat their employees as a cost will focus on ways to reduce the role played by them.  But an owner who recognizes that workers are his most valuable resource will seek to magnify their contribution, partly by higher pay, but also through better training and greater reliance on their capacity to improve company performance.  Enhanced employee loyalty and greater productivity will more than offset higher upfront costs.  Ton's model employer is not a philanthropist but simply a smart businesswoman.",0.9942
2,"Richard Luettgen might be right that Ms. Ton's model has limited scalability, but it could probably be used a lot more widely than it is now.  The model is a good description of how top-tier management consultants and investment banks run their businesses -- they offer a premium wage to attract great talent, in exchange for which they ask employees to play an active part in creating value and (re)defining their role.  Compared to other firms, they turn the employment contract upside down.  Instead of assuming you keep your job until you screw up, you assume you lose your job unless you find ways to make a difference.  That model doesn't need to be limited to elite institutions.  Smart and energetic workers can be found in every industry and at every wage level.  The challenge for companies is managerial: being clear about what you're looking for, managing with the flexibility to give workers real opportunity to demonstrate initiative, and evaluating employees in fair and transparent ways that recognize their full impact on the business.

3,"I worked at Amazon for about four years with the senior-most people in the company. Of course it was stressful! Lots of jobs are stressful. Hardly any can be as rewarding and lucrative as Amazon. People are tough, but they’re also sweet and caring. Laughter is welcome. To me, this article took a bunch of bad stuff and made those things the the whole culture, when it's never that simple. <br/><br/>Bad managers are not unique to Amazon<br/>In a company of 20,000, managers are going to do dumb things. Sorry haters, embarrassing stuff happens at your company too, so stop judging. <br/><br/>Doing extraordinary things is hard<br/>Do you hear the Navy Seals saying, “Why is this training so hard? It’s super painful! Please make it easier!” No. Navy Seals want to do stuff that others can't, so they willingly go through “hell” to get a certain result. <br/><br/>Sometimes the hardest things are the best things<br/>Take raising a kid for example. It’s not for the faint of heart, but there’s also nothing better. The exhilaration of doing amazing work is a gift, which is why so many people stay at Amazon. And even if they leave after a time, it doesn’t mean they didn’t love it.<br/><br/>It’s a choice<br/>Amazon doesn’t hide that it has high standards. If you’re smart enough to get a job there, you can get a great job somewhere else. You’re not going to be panhandling if things don’t work out there. <br/><br/>People in a position to work at Amazon have the power to set their own boundaries and live by their own rules.",0.9849
4,"In reply to AACNY, the Democratic Party has not "" created a monster,"" but is finally coming back to its populist, working class roots: defense and respect for the American worker. If AACNY were an engineer, say, for Disney or the power company in Caifornia, both of which have fired long time employees in favor of those holding HB-l visas, willing to work cheap and with fewer benefits, all in the name of increasing profits, then AACNY would not be so scornful of those who maintain that TPP, like other, similar agreements, is bad news for US citizens in general.If they were here today, Samuel Gompers, Rosa Luxembourg, and Walter Reuther , among others, would be proud of the Democratic Party for going to bat for workers marginalized by the abovementioned TPP and other international trade deals, which benefit mainly corporations, but are helping to sound the deathknell for the working classes in this great country of ours.

5,"1.) You seem to be conflating corporations with government. Companies like Amazon don't give a hoot about America, they are global. Great companies != great country.<br/><br/>2.) You're advocating slave morality. The lion's share of company profits go to the wealthy: the largest shareholders. There is no reason for regular people to devote their single existence to lining the pockets of the wealthy.<br/><br/>3.) Our current economic and political systems are still relatively new in human history. There is nothing objectively good or worthy about them. We should be maximizing for human happiness, not the arbitrary standards of success within our current system (e.g. profits). ",0.9804
6,"My dad was a supervisor in one department of an auto trim factory here in the Detroit area.  He had about 2000 people reporting to him through the chain of foremen and general foremen.  There were peers in this one parts plant with similar or larger departments.  Workers were paid a good wage, the work place was quite safe and clean, and people were treated reasonably well through the UAW system. (I worked there as an hourly employee so I have first-hand knowledge).) This mass, semi-skilled, living-wage, employment is gone.<br/><br/>We are delighted at Shinola's success here in Detroit.  We have been to their mid-town store, though their beautiful products are mostly too pricey for us.  They spawned a several blocks of other small shops on neighboring streets as well as some great restaurants.  This pattern is replicated in many areas near downtown.<br/><br/>The issue, though, is not a few dozen jobs or even Dan Gilbert's hundreds of employees.  The loss of scores of thousands of solid middle-class jobs is the real issue.  Replacing these jobs will take something along the lines of a massive public/private infrastructure investment or a sea change in the ""buy foreign - buy cheap"" ethic that has driven large-scale production out of the US.",0.9768
7,"Here is the key question in the article:<br/><br/>""But policy makers have never directly focused their will and resources on creating good jobs at good pay. Instead, they seem intent on acting as if the labor market will heal completely on its own. It hasn’t and it won’t.""<br/><br/>Once again, the liberal assumption that the  Government can best rectify the situation is a false one.  By continually trying to thwart a free market economy, by creating ways to 'milk' small business, saddle them with mandatory health care expenditures, ad nauseum, companies will recoup these costs through less hiring, creative hiring practices to get around government mandates, etc.<br/><br/>What has to be done is to get big government out of the way, and allow companies flourish.  This lack of job pay increase, comes from the knock on the door, ""I am from the federal government, and I am here to help you"" grow your business and increase hiring - it will never work.  ",0.9761
8,"These are very common practices in modern corporate life.  Everything said in this story was common practice fifteen years ago when I involuntarily left it.<br/><br/>Yes, Indian contractors routinely ship contract employers over on H1-B authorization or other, shorter-term work visas.  Yes, they take the place of American employees permanently.  Yes, they're not very good, often -- but what really matters is that some VP got to show that he cut costs 10 percent and that makes the shareholders happy.  The fact that they're not very productive or competent will only come home to roost after he's moved to another job.<br/><br/>This is taking place all across American worklife.  In corporations, nothing matters but the quarterly bottom line.  The fact that they're hollowing out the society that actually supports their business is not in their job descriptions.  No more so than the VP who ""saves money"" with H1-B contractors then gets out before the bad news starts to roll in.<br/><br/>And there are other variations on this.  When a start-up company is purchased by a large corporation, much of the work is eventually off-shored to a foreign subsidiary.  And yes, the start-up employees get to train their replacements before being shown the door.  And no, they don't all get much in the way of options.  <br/><br/>The point is, and what you've all assumed, that business is supposed to support our society and help it thrive.  It is failing, even as it continually touts its successes: at making the rich richer.",0.9755
9,"Go to a Cosco than visit a Walmart you will observe something like this, but Cosco is the exception.  This is a pleasant article, full of hope, but still it relies on the goodness of greed, an oxymoron.  It is easier to lower wages than to imagine a better world where rewarded workers produce more for  captains of industry, funds and  stockholders.  However; the ideas is counter intuitive, and more complex.   Corporate America will always chose the easier way if allowed to.  And that is to beat up on the workers.   ",0.9735

11,"As a former employee of a company with soul-draining pressure and humiliating micro management, this story struck a chord with me; and Amazon sounds much worse!  Their employees, however, are free to buy running shoes from their employer at a good price, quickly delivered, to put on and flee as quickly, and as far, as they wish.  <br/><br/>I admire the customers (former customers, that is) who wish to follow their convictions and close their Amazon accounts. I suspect an overwhelming majority won't, even after reading this excellent column.  They will continue, as I have, to benefit from Amazon's unmatched selection, competitive prices and fantastic service.<br/><br/>Apparently Amazon is a win-win-win for customers, Jeff Bezos' bank accounts and workers who get high on some hyper-competitive vision of achievement whatever the cost.

12,"Corporations strive for shareholder return through profits and for executive remuneration.  Executives (and most shareholders) are very open and flexible as to how to achieve those goals.  Liberal reforms that promote inclusion, immigration reform that simplify and expand the labor market, and any law that makes their employees happy without corporate expense are worth corporate support.<br/><br/>Corporations are not immoral (i.e. evil).

14,"Perhaps an easy ""fix"" is to insert a couple of requirements into the H1-B program such that :<br/><br/>(A) All candidates considered for the H1-B visa must have acquired at least a three or four year degree from a U.S. college in whatever field the applicant's job pertains to.  This would (1) wean out those who are clearly unqualified or have unverified qualifications, and (2) raise the cost of outsourcing as the candidates have to pay off the cost of acquiring their US degrees.  <br/><br/>(B) US companies seeking to outsource functions to H1-B ""farms"" must pay a 10% levy on the cost of the outsourced work.  The levy would be used a retraining fund for the displaced American worker.<br/><br/>The combination of the two would help level the playing field for American workers while not taking away the ability of American companies to hire the best qualified candidates, wherever their origins might be.  <br/><br/>CEOs are, by nature or force, short sighted - they are required to report on revenues, costs and profitability on a quarterly basis and their tenure depends on how well they appear to be doing versus the competition.  By removing the incentive to cut cost at the expense (and the future) of American workers, they will be forced to show how well they are doing for America as a whole and not just the percentage gains in sales and profitability.",0.9638

16,"Our current dilemma stems in part from the adversarial relationship between labor and management in this country.  That relationship, in turn, owes its acceptance to the American obsession with competition.  The idea that competition supplies the fuel that drives economic growth developed in the 19th century and affects every strand of our social and economic thought.  It encourages employers to view their workers as a cost instead of a resource.  It stimulates unions to conceive of the collective bargaining process as a zero/sum game.  In contrast, companies in some European countries, notably Germany, place union representatives on corporate boards.  The challenge for Americans, especially business leaders (since they enjoy most of the power), involves nothing less than a recognition that cooperation can contribute as much to the well-being of our society as competition.  Regarding their workers as assets to be developed and valued rather than as costs to be trimmed would help transform the pay structure and encourage employees to re-imagine their relationship to the company.  That would be a good start toward the goal Mr. Georgescu seeks to achieve.",0.9612
17,"The professor speaks of the personal rewards of social responsibility when our increasingly corporate America has twisted or abandoned the concept.<br/><br/>When I was little, my brother took Dad and I on a tour of his electronics plant. It helped instill in me the concept of enjoying and taking pride in what you do for a living. Management valued Mr. Fix-it's extra hours and his analytical and troubleshooting skills. His boss sent him to TQM training, then granted his family a cross-country vacation during a lull -- do it now while you've got the chance, he said.<br/><br/>A year later that boss was killed in an auto accident. The replacements claimed they had to get more competitive with Japan, of all things, so their fresh TQM grad with 18 years' company experience, 38 with only an associate degree, was shown the door. <br/><br/>That was '89. Never again did 'Bro put family pictures on his desk. His son has a good job, but has also authored a joke book about corporate culture. His daughter went into academia.

18,"""a sense of purpose and empowerment at work, can be every bit as profitable as companies that strive to keep their labor costs low""<br/><br/>That was certainly true in the business of running a lawfirm. Who does a client want? A cheap lawyer, or one who wins? A cheap secretary, or one who seems to know as much as the lawyer. A cheap paralegal, or one who seems to know as much as the lawyer. Clients pay for what they want. The work shows the results. Winning pays even better.<br/><br/>A client of mine ran a big plumbing business. We talked about this. Who do you want as a plumber? And I am assured that happy plumbers do much better work too.<br/><br/>Another client of mine ran an accounting firm. Who do you want? Not just the accountant, but his staff.<br/><br/>Another client ran a bar. You might think that is a low end, non-professional business. You'd be mistaken. People are vulnerable. A happy evening is even more vulnerable. It makes a big difference, from quality of food, to service, to how everyone is kept orderly yet happy, and that shows in profit.<br/><br/>In so many different businesses, quality pays off.

19,But I think you missed the point of the column.  The workers in these stores didn't need to worry about competing with low-paid workers in China or anywhere else.  They were being paid decent wages and given appropriate training to do jobs right here.  Labor costs went up but other costs went down; at the same time stores were more profitable when employees provided better customer service and fulfilled other job activities (such as carrying out promotional events) as required.  We could scrap fair trade agreements but American employers could just continue to pay their workers as little as possible anyhow.,0.9528
20,"Part of HCL America getting an H1-B visa for its foreign employee is they must do a Labor Condition Application (LCA) wherein they ""promise not to place the employee at another employer's worksite unless the employer has made a bona fide inquiry as to whether the other employer has displaced or intends to displace a US worker any time between 90 days before and 90 days after the placement, and has no contrary knowledge. If the other employer makes such a displacement, the employer applicant may be subject to civil money penalties and disbarment.""  I guess this is why the future ""displacee"" is given 90 days notice.  Change the law - either there is the intention to displace or there is not - 90 days is irrelevant.<br/>More actionable today:  ""Prior to filing any petition for a H-1B nonimmigrant pursuant to the application, the employer took or will take good faith steps to meet industry-wide standards to recruit US workers for the job for which the nonimmigrant is sought, offering compensation at least as great as that required to be offered to the non-immigrant. The employer will (has) offer(ed) the job to an equally or better qualified US worker.""

21,"I'll say it again - the smartest people I know, which include an Ivy professor of medicine, a Nobel laureate in physics, and a world renowned AIDS researcher (and my cousin) were never in it for the money, not one of them.  And in my own experience as a consultant to some of the largest companies on the planet, few of their executives demonstrated more than somewhat above average intelligence.  What most did demonstrate, beyond all doubt, was a commitment to make themselves as much money as possible, and to do whatever it took to achieve that goal.  I am afraid what you are talking about, as many other readers have already said, is a breakdown in ethics in the executive suite.  Further, boards of directors must be held accountable for 1) allowing executive compensation to increase in far too many instances to levels wildly in excess of value contribution, 2) for financial and tax gimmickry, and 3) for complete disregard of and even contempt for employees and customers.

It is set up for the benefit of exploitative middlemen and body shoppers.<br/>After getting my masters degree from an American Ivy league university, I decided to work in Europe. A poor decision, as it turned out. Now I want to get back to the US, and there are plenty of American companies who want to hire me, but cannot. Why? Because H1 visa applications open in April and are sold out on the first day - all taken by IT body shoppers, who will later use these visas to transfer some of their current employees to the US for ""projects"". So why can't these American companies who want to hire me apply for my H1 visa in April? Well, mostly because even if I get the visa, I can only start working in October, as per the H1 visa rules. So although they like me, they cannot leave the position vacant for 7 months. And there are hundreds of thousands of IT outsourcers applying for some 65k visas, so the chances of me getting the visa are bleak anyway, even if they do hire me in April.

26,"That Walker’s celebratory dinner was at a restaurant named Bacchus is wonderfully fitting since politicians like him, and his oligarchic puppet masters, have been living a Bacchanal for decades at the expense of the American worker. <br/><br/>Since Ronald Reagan’s union busting in 1981, the Republican Party has worked to destroy every vestige of union activity in our nation. The reason, of course, is because sensible regulations, and labor laws that protect American workers against exploitation, run counter to the oligarch’s desires to wring every cent out of the American landscape, no matter the effect to our environment, or how badly it erodes our quality of life. <br/><br/>Whenever a Republican speaks of “small government” what they really mean is a government controlled by a small number of incredibly wealthy corporate interests.

28,Wow Jeff Bezos is running his own damage control and they sent a kid to Linkedin who has worked at Amazon for a year to pretend like he wrote his Op-Ed there without the permission of management. Good JobNYT! I saws wondering when the truth about Amazon would come out. As a former Seattleite who lived next door to two Amazon executives and who has had many friends working at Amazon I think this article was more than fair. And it actually let Amazon off the hook a little. There is a BIG difference between working hard and being abused. Companies like Amazon were the reasons unions flourished in the early part of the last century. The treatment of employees there is so bad that they have a very hard time filling positions with qualified candidates. Bullying and bad behavior always starts at the top. And Jeff Bezos is a world class bully. Right up there with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. But at least the last two tried to make up for their atrocious behavior with employee perks. Funny how we crucify kids for bullying but celebrate it in megalomaniacs who make billions of dollars. And to those who say *Look what they invented--it changed the world!*. I say the world is NOT a better or more efficient place because of their inventions. In fact I believe the opposite.

Our infra structure is 3rd world -- and our food and drug inspectors are not on the mark so we need this to improve but the deadwood has to go and I think Trump has the where with all to burn and slash all the waste because he knows about the bottom line stuff.  And the bottom line is a good thing because it cuts zeroes in on cost  and focuses on needs and cuts waste, fraud and abuse--- if done right.<br/><br/>I like Bernie -- but will vote Trump.  ",-0.9559
257,"I worked in the Bay Area (tech industry) for nearly 15 years. All of my jobs were quite similar in culture to what the article describes. Let me tell you this type of ""performance"" oriented workplace leads to a lot of backstabbing, bad feelings, and stress. I think there was a fight almost every day at the last tech industry job I had. <br/><br/>The data and numbers are just used as a means to punish the work force by control freak supervisors. I walked away from that entire nightmare and have zero plans of ever returning. Part of it is my health - in my 40's I don't the stamina for that sort of thing anymore. The other part is - you'll work like a dog with very little to show for it when it's all over. <br/><br/>There's a certain kind of person who thrives in this environment - but that person wasn't me. Working that way only caused me health problems, stress, and disappointment. ",-0.958
258,"Given similar gun violence by terminated employees returning to their former workplace with murder on their minds, it would seem prudent for management to learn more humane ways of firing people and to provide  counseling and followup.  Losing a job is a traumatic experience and some of those terminated have killed themselves or gone after their bosses. There needs to be national conversation on this subject with more leadership from the Labor Department and the White House.",-0.9761
259,"First of all NYT needs to check that lie about it being only 85,000, they have so many loopholes that it ends up being about 3 times that many. That is 85,000 NEW visas a year so they are not even counting the ones who have already been here for years. <br/><br/>This is not just happening in the so called 'tech' industry either, it is in every kind of employment imaginable. <br/><br/>The schools in the US firing all of their American teachers so that they can ship in slave labor from third world countries is so vast that they have caused a teacher shortage in the Philippines. <br/><br/>There have been dozens of lawsuits by those immigrants who get here only to be abused and exploited by the same people who abused and exploited American workers. Recently a group of them won their lawsuit against the Louisiana school system but t happens in virtually every state. <br/><br/>I have family members in Mississippi that have worked in the seafood processing industry there for at least 4 generations, several years ago those seafood packing plants fired all of their American workers and shipped in slave labor on visas. <br/><br/>In one plant there were 3 generations from the same family working there and the oldest had been doing that work for over 30 years. They were ALL fired on made up charges as soon as the owner received his allotment of visas! <br/><br/>It is happening in every industry and has been happening for over a decade so that is probably 10 million workers or more who have been displaced by the visa scam.",-0.9792
