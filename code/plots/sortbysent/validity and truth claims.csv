The major care the state must be aware of is the horde of money changers who would without doubt prey on the state's new currency.... but in the end, the value of the  created money is all about the worth of the trust of the state's people.   The Greek people have demonstrated that they are indeed a great industrious people and worthy of our trust.",0.9842

A whole lot!   So please educate yourselves to the psychiatric issue and mental illness which is GID.

5,"Why did she have to lie about her race? IF her intent was to be an advocate for social justice and peaceful change, then couldn't she have done that effectively as a white woman? You cannot simply adopt a racial identity because you ""identify"" with that race, that's plain and simple dishonest. Effective leadership is first and foremost about being authentic and she lacked that quality. <br/><br/>She's probably been living in constant fear of the truth being revealed, thanks to her parents she's been exposed as the fraud and phony that she really is. The fact that she's been living a lie for decades and has been actively trying to conceal her background, speaks more about her own inner personal demons and turmoil than anything else. At some point hopefully she can start living as who she really is now that this is out in the open. Good luck to her, it's going to be a long, rough road back to normal. ",0.9192

THIS is what we wanted to see jarringly proven night after night by the juxtaposition of news clips reeking of utter hypocrisy -- not a show about liberals examining ""themselves more carefully and to admit that both ideological camps contain fools.""

20,"Well, of course myths matter more than reality. Myths express a people's sense of their community's meaning and purpose. Reality demonstrates that our lives are contingent, that random events play the largest parts in our destinies, that meaning is an illusion we create to shield us from the terrors of despair.<br/><br/>We need myths. We need myths that encourage us to what we know we should do. We need myths to make order and sense of the messy confusion of our lives.

If a college scholarship is awarded to those of African American heritage only-which is different than self identification- and a person of Caucasian heritage only lied on the application, that would be unethical and probably illegal. I'm sure there are better examples. <br/><br/>All that really matters here is any fabrication she may have done for gain - such as the claim she possibly lied on police reports,to gain attention, that ended in costing taxpayer money.

70,"As a practicing psychologist, and a member of Psychologists for Social Responsibility, I am glad that this has finally seen the light of day. For too long the American Psychological Association has rationalized the involvement of psychologists involved in these horrific actions, marginalized those of us who spoke up, and disregarded the idea that there should be sanctions against the psychologists involved. The APA had known about this for years. They have also made a lot of money by going along with both the CIA and the military. Furthermore, I would offer that we have just seen the ""tip of the iceberg"" so to speak. So far, only high ranking person in the APA, Dr. Behnke, has been fired, or quit. Hopefully, some of the others that are as complicit as Dr. Behnke will be also let go. I am not an attorney, but I hope that if there is an attorney reading this, he or she can let us know if there is any way we can sue the APA for tarnishing our profession. Some of these people are, in my opinion, no better than any other person who tortures. Many of us have fought long and hard with the APA to distance themselves from this abomination, but perhaps there was just too much money and greed for the ""higher ups"" within the APA to sanction those who were involved, or if nothing else, condemn the psychologists that were involved, whether they were members of the APA or not.

We, the citizens of the United States, must take responsibility for actions done in the name of the United States, our country, even if ""we"" are recent immigrants with no responsibility whatsoever for those earlier actions.  It is the nature of responsibility.  Should a corporation not be responsible for the pollution it has caused because it is under new ownership, or has a new CEO?

122,"It's not that Ms. Dolezal has adopted, ""identifies with"", appreciates, or is intimately associated with black culture.  There's nothing wrong with any of that.  This is about plain deception.  When you know that people have a false impression either because of things you have said in the past or failed to correct and you allow that impression to persist, you can expect fall out.  This has nothing to do with the ""one drop"" rule or being half-black-half-white because she is none of those things.  She was just lying because she wished to be something that she plainly is not.  Don't misunderstand, there's no shame in being black, white, asian, or any other race (or combination).  The SHAME is in Ms. Dolezal's misrepresentations by omission and actual falsehood.  She still refuses to admit deception.  Instead she echoes the tired line about doing certain interviews ""differently"" ""knowing what I know now.""  Know what?  She hasn't learned any new facts about herself since those interviews took place.  I guess she means if she knew that one day someone would stumble across the truth of the matter, she may not have lied, but how is that different from anyone else.  It's not like she committed some unforgivable crime (surely, her contributions to society have outpaced a single lie at this point, no matter how embarrassing), but the strained explanations are tiresome.",-0.9368
