0,"We did almost the same trip, but in reverse order, a couple of years ago, in the summer, and it was delightful.  St.-Jean-de-Luz is like a smaller Santa Barbara but French.  When we got to St-Jean-Pied-de-Port. it was full of people starting on their pilgramage to Santiago de Compestela, because this is one of the starting points.<br/>Another interesting fact is when the Jews were expelled from Spain at the start of the Inquisition, many when across the border and settled in Bayonne.  They brought their chocolate making skills, and Bayonne chocolate, if you need an excuse to buy chocolate, is now famous.  The museum mentioned in the article has a room devoted to the Jews of Bayonne.<br/>We had lunch next store to the museum at La Bayonaisse, which was really good, and staying in St.-Jean-de-Luz was a good decision.  It was smaller than Biarritz or Bayonne and easier to navigate.  We liked it and would go back.  Flying into Bordeaux, renting a car and driving 2.5 hours south is an easy way to get there.  Another trip is flying into Bordeaux and driving 1 - 2 hours east, which is how you get to the Dordogne.  Fabulous.",0.99
1,"Sure. I grew up in that predominantly black neighborhood, in rural Berkeley County, South Carolina, in a town called Huger. Perfectly safe (I can send you law enforcement data), clean (check several years of Google maps images if you need satellite proof), extremely friendly (ask my mother's white tenants, who now occupy my late grandmother's home) and inquire with one of the honors students, nurses, teachers, journalists or engineers who've been produced by my block. Pretty positive attributes and made me who I am today. Have an excellent day C.Asaki!",0.9794
2,"I like the idea of the art display. what about the love lock building/museum go in there if you want to attach your locks or view them, of course built to be structurally sound to carry very large amount of weight. Those who think it's an eyesore don't have to see it but an exterior that matches the beauty of the city. Win Win. I personally don't understand the locks but to each their own and if they are going to keep trying to find other areas give them one that is appealing on the outside. charge a small fee, have a shop inside with pretty locks to purchase and engrave your lock for an extra fee, and place your lock inside that building and inside that building only.",0.9786
3,"I'll back up Mr. Kilner's recommendation of Sumahan on the Water. It's a lovely hotel with a superb restaurant. The staff (all of whom speak English) are friendly and helpful. Sumahan also has a regular boat service direct to the European side of the Bosporus, which makes it easy to visit all of the usual tourist sites (Hagia Sophia, Topkapi, Grand Bazaar, etc) and then escape back to a haven of peace at the end of the day.",0.975
4,"I feel we as humans need to stick together and stand up for one another in a grand and unified manner. Why does it matter if someone is attracted to their gender? Why does it matter where we are from? At the end of the day we are all just the same flesh and bone as the next person. In the article, a guitarist by the name of Aston Kruger said “is this going to be a tearing part? Or a pivot point of people trying to understand each other, trying to live together?” Personally I hope the latter occurs. It would be a huge leap for mankind if two nations who hate every last iota of each other to be unified and accept one another. The part in the article that I am really optimistic about is when it mentioned that “Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men” would like to speak to the gay community. Hopefully this could bridge a lot of tension between the religious group and the LGBT community. This is a bridge that I feel needs to be built, not just over there but everywhere. If we talk we are able to understand, and if we are able to understand, we are able to accept each other as humans. That would be the perfect outcome of this. It seems that Israel is a nation that would negotiate, and there is no doubt in my mind that they shall “Soul-Search” and find the answer that resides within themselves. We’ve seen big changes coming out of the world these past couple of months, and I hope we can see more. Let’s all stand and make a world that the next generation shall be proud to live in! ",0.9721
5,"On a related note, since Denali park is a jewel, we should all thank Obama for making it a priority to expand our national parklands and wilderness areas.  <br/><br/>I understand that out west sometimes this isn't popular -- as it's viewed as federal encroachment.  <br/><br/>But I hope our fellow Americans out west can appreciate how all Americans have an interest in the preservation of our nation's natural beauty.  <br/><br/>I hope that sentiment",0.9673
6,"My daughter moved into one of these inner city neighborhoods. The streets were pretty and lined with beautiful old houses.  She made lots of friends and I found these people to be friendly, vibrant and interesting.   <br/><br/>However, summer nights were a different story.  Shooting, lots of shooting, and burglaries.  Loud talking, joking, fist fights at 3 AM.  Some people have to get up and go to work.  She lived there for 3 more years and decided the negative aspects outweighed the positive aspects.  She moved.  Back to the boring suburbs.  Boring can be peaceful year around.  ",0.9531
7,"steve - places that increase the value of the education they provide will see increases in property values; under your theory, the best schools would always be in the largest cities, since that's where the highest property values are - for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are property tax give backs to businesses, we can both agree that the largest cities, where property valuations are high, are not public schooling paragons.",0.9393

10,"I live not far from Times Square and frequently walk my dogs there. I like the pedestrian mall. Complaining about too many people is ridiculous -- it's saying basically that they'e too successful. <br/><br/>Maybe it's because I remember the '70s, when you wouldn't walk through Times Square in midday, but I think it's a very pleasant. These commenters sound like a bunch of curmudgeons. If you don't like it, don't go there! ",0.9285
11,"Sorry, Mr. Krugman, but I think the British passenger trains are far superior to ours.  We rent a house outside of Windsor every year and go into London and up north by train and they are timely, clean and comfortable and also don't make half the noise ours do.  So I must beg to differ on this one. ",0.9274
12,"I once attempted to rent to a Section 8 tenant.  I had just vacated a beautifully restored 19th century apartment which was all original with elaborate woodwork, stained glass windows, wide board floors, fresh white painted walls and cream painted woodwork.  The section 8 was a high school drop out woman with an illegitimate child and no money.  The section 8 inspector came and insisted that one of the original wavy glass windowpanes which I had preserved so carefully be replaced because there was a 3"" crack in one corner.   I thanked her for her trouble, explained to the potential tenant that section 8 had found the place not up to their standards and rented to a young White couple who both had jobs and were not sucking up my taxpayer dollars for free housing. ",0.9215
13,"All you say has merit EXCEPT this is not an article of having kids married or not. I believe it is about Section 8 vouchers and difficulty in finding landowners will to take Section 8 tenants. I do not believe in racism but in the best answer to the problem. Ghettos should be cleaned up. Whites will and should not be responsible for this other than by making sure social services are adequate, such as schools, policing, transportation etc. Section 8 housing OFTEN brings down neighborhoods because the same life style that was in the Ghetto is brought along with the tenants. The solution should occur at the origin. African Americans have reasons to feel marginalized. The solution is complex but partly to move all neighborhoods to a higher state. ",0.9091

15,"I've worked with my contractor on three subsequent renovations of different homes in NYC, and they have always come in on-time and on-budget (unless I have been responsible for change orders, which has happened).  Having said that, during my most recent reno (a complete wall to wall gut job of a co-op on 57th Street) I simply looked to find another unit in my building that was for rent (there was a small studio unit on the market), and then had the doorman call the owner directly - who was thrilled to rent to me short term (for five months) because there no building management paperwork to go through for a tenant who already was a shareholder themselves.  I think my rent for the studio was around $2500/month, and the additional added bonus was living in the same building where my reno was taking place, so I could easily assess my contractor's progress on a daily basis.",0.8996
16,"Any family that truly loved your parents, would asset them in moving to a more affordable area than San Francisco -- literally the most costly real estate in the nation!<br/><br/>They don't have to necessarily leave California, just move to one of the more affordable parts.

17,"Even if Mayor DeBlasio loses a second term in ignominy, his Pre-K initiative will still guarantee his status as a historic mayor. The best President Obama was able to do was mention it in a State of the Union address, and then immediately hit a brick wall with Congress. <br/><br/>Thankfully our 4 year old made it through the lottery, and will be attending subsidized Pre K in the fall. We'll be saving on day care fees, and that will help us facilitate our long deferred dream of owning a home. Affordable Pre K is a rare perk for the beleaguered middle class in this day and age.",0.8957
18,"I appreciate Guy Trebay's visitor's perspective on Tucson and its built environment, which is rather different from mine, but that doesn't make either of us right or wrong. I lived in Tucson from 1973 to '95, and wrote about Arizona's architecture for one of Tucson's newspapers and several different magazines during that time. In my view, most of the city's midcentury modern architecture and strip development outlines a story of cheap land, expedient city planning, and developers' rush to make a quick buck before anyone could see what was being destroyed. Tucson occupies one of the most spectacular natural settings of any city in North America, and the narrative of its urban development is one of the people failing the land.<br/><br/>There is, however, the delightful quirkiness Mr. Trebay notes; and a number of unsung architectural gems. I would recommend the Wilmot Library at 6th and Wilmot (built in 1956, I believe); and Ventana Canyon Resort (1982). The latter is a riff on an unbuilt Frank Lloyd Wright hotel design and illustrates how to integrate a very large building into a delicate desert mountain landscape with grace and sensitivity.<br/><br/>I like the Chase bank branch Mr. Trebay cites, but I always wished the original design Valley Bank had commissioned for that site had been built instead. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1920s design for it incorporated an unheard-of innovation—a drive-up teller booth so clients could do their banking without leaving their cars.",0.8938

Several women there were open about their plan to have babies on a regular basis to stay on AFDC.  That was their life choice.  In talking with them they said ""everybody did it.""  I know this is a small sample size but it clearly does happen. Still a liberal, I can't disagree with Bush on this.

27,"I concur with Bill Jacobs.  The happy hour caters more towards local residents than tourists, so I don't buy the argument put forth by the bill's supporters.  Sure, some of those residents can take the CTA home, but many suburban workers drive either into the city or to other suburbs for work.  This is the source of the risk of having discounted happy hours.  ",0.8483
28,"The laws as currently structured are bringing a small but steady stream of apartments into the market-rate realm.  This protects regulated existing tenants while keeping the market tight, benefiting the majority of property owners.  Many old walk-ups in wealthier NYC neighborhoods have a mix of regulated and market-rate units--the owners of these buildings are doing very well, from what I can tell.<br/><br/>The pro and con  arguments about rent regulation haven't changed for decades.  In my opinion, they're a load of nonsense.  Anybody who believes that ending rent regulation will suddenly make wealthier neighborhoods in New York more affordable is dreaming.",0.8413
29,"Why haven't we stopped building new homes? Nobody has even mentioned that! There are massive suburban developments on the table which could easily be postponed if not cancelled. Why do I have to take shorter showers while wealthy land developers keep building more homes? Where's the Governor on that issue? I'll tell you where he is- as always, hiding in the pocket of the land developers. Not for nothing, but this guy has got to go! His greatest accomplishment in the last 4 years is banning plastic bags in grocery stores [which was postponed by the way] and allowing dogs to eat with their owners in restaurants with outdoor patios! Good Grief!  ",0.8406
30,"On June 6, 2015, ten days before the rent regulations laws expired, Cuomo published an editorial in the NYDaily News: ""My affordable housing agenda"", in which he laid out the following goals: ""We must eliminate vacancy decontrol or at the very least significantly raise vacancy decontrol thresholds; further limit vacancy bonuses to ensure landlords aren’t rewarded financially for schemes to force tenants out; make major capital improvements and individual apartment improvement surcharges that go away once recovered by landlords, instead of ways of artificially raising a unit’s monthly rent; and make the preferential rent operate as the legal rent for the life of the tenancy. These should be foundational elements of any new rent regulation legislation.""<br/><br/>And then, predictably, he proceeded to betray every single one of the above stated goals, selling out yet again to the real estate interests which have consistently pumped an insurmountable edge in cash into his campaign coffers. <br/><br/>Arrogance and cynicism are a hallmark of his governing style. His decision to pull the plug on his corruption-fighting Moreland Commission speaks volumes.   His serious character flaws were also evident when he refused  to debate Zephyr Teachout -and even went as far as ignored her attempt to greet him by turning his back on her at a Labor Day Parade.  Despite it all, she still got almost 35 percent of the vote, mine as well.",0.836
31,"Many cities in Florida face exactly the same conundrum, how to integrate races. When one group of people faces prejudice by another the only way for change is the  long road of changing attitudes. My belief is that  minorities fix problems in the broken neighborhoods making them more attractive and desirous to live. This requires support from community leaders and money to wipe out crime and blight. Given time these areas will integrate themselves as property values increase, schools improve, crime is lessened, etc. Cities that are rich in talent thrive and economic opportunity thrive and Section 8 vouchers become a thing of the past.",0.8155

33,"Your are absolutely  right.  I would also say:  It's been said ""a man is known by the company he keeps.""  I would add a child and family are shaped by the company they keep.  In a public high school in New York City (Charles Evans Hughes) I got to keep the very best company in Regents and Honors classes, classmates who remained friends throughout the decades.  That shaped my teen years more than anything else.  It seems that public housing for the poor should be scattered into good not super-wealthy  communities where the community  is large can be a force for good.  I don't mean rebuilding  a concentration of poor in these communities, but rather a small group that may choose to take advantage of what's available in each of them.  ",0.8045
34,"In our Eastside (of Seattle area) we are again seeing McMansions going up on streets that at one time had modest homes with nice yards surrounding every house.  Now there is not only a ginormous house that takes up almost every bit of the lot, but these monstrosities also block precious daylight to any poor next-door neighbor in his beloved little bungalow where he's raised a family.  It destroys the ambiance of the neighborhood.  And who cleans these 12,000 square foot mausoleums, I mean...'houses'?  The whole thing is upsetting, from the way the For Sale sign barely comes down before bulldozers come chuffing in and demolish everything in an afternoon.  I've seen them destroy beautiful granite counter tops, cedar shake roofs, recently remodeled kitchens and master bedrooms without any attempt to recycle valuable materials.  Then a family of 3 moves in to the new place that has never less than a 3-car garage, 6 bedrooms, 6 bathrooms, a 'theater room', and a walk-in wine pantry.  But the construction, itself...ooh, so shoddy but made to look palatial if all you take is a quick glance.

35,"De Blasio loves to visit Europe where, I'm sure, he has spent substantial time drinking coffee or a beer at some plaza in Rome, London, Paris, etc.  Europeans have been doing this for ages and never have a problem.

36,"I lived in New York throughout the 80s and 90s and now spend a week there every month.  The construct of the rude (or eccentric) New Yorker as the only authentic New Yorker is tired...a skewed form of self-regard for the likes of Mr. Quinn, who fancies himself the only ""real"" thing in a city that, just like anyplace else, is and always was mostly composed of regular people going about their lives in regular ways.  Yes, yes, we get it...you miss 1970s Times Square, any other way of existing is lame, and you're the enlightened insider.  It sounds as though this show is not much more than a warm embrace of empty stereotypes and formulaic generalizations of the type that were en vogue among the NYC comedy circuit's ""grimy elite"" in the 1980s.

Having lived in Europe the past 17 years, I can assure you that there are not topless or spray-painted women running around in the city centers/squares. Public nudity is illegal in most european countries due to the fact the there are children and minors in the area, and the government cannot regulate that. Entertainment acts of any kind require a legal permit, and the performers are fined large sums of money without one. It is important that the acts are decent (especially in a bustling place like Times Square, ""where 480,000 people — tourists and locals — walk daily""). I am not saying that nudity is wrong, but it is not appropriate in one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections.

Back in the day when big chains avoided these neighborhoods like the plague the bodegas was the neighborhood's Stop and Shop. Living in the city most people were forced to shop locally for most people didn't own a car. If you were one of the lucky ones who owned a car you would lose your parking spot if you made a milk run to the not so local supermarket. You understood that the owner of the Bodegas had to charge more for his goods just to stay above water. When big chains made attempts to open up in these areas the Bodegas owners fought them tooth and nail. Now that the demographics have changed and the new people in the neighborhood require you to sell fresh food and not overcharge them you have to close shop? To the good owners who didn’t sell old meat, beer and cigarettes to minors and did their best to serve the neighborhood I wish you the best of luck. To the stiffs who exploited the poor people who couldn’t afford to go anywhere else I say Que Sera, Sera.  ",0.6319

Her old 1852 home was no longer safe.  My wife talked of moving back there. I pointed out that roads that needed left turn lights and lanes 40 years ago still didn't have them. People were using plastic bags as winter window insulation. and the tax on this new 1600 sq. ft house on 1/10 acre was $6800 and that was with a $3017 state subsidy. For comparison my house in Charlotte is bigger and has a $2600 tax. My ocean front in Emerald Isle is 1600 sq. ft and is less than $3000. Her 3 brothers live in run down houses and can't afford to fix them because taxes eat up any money they have.<br/>My wife was unhappy to leave it 36 years ago but realizes that it was a good move for us.

Transportation, food, medical care, clothing, etc. are all things that need to be considered.  If someone's income does not allow them to afford the cost of living in an affluent neighborhood, how are they to survive?  If they do not get the money to live, they're not much better off than before (in fact, they may be worse off if things are cheaper in poorer neighborhoods).  If the plan is for them to be simply GIVEN the money, it must come from somewhere.  Is the local community to be taxed for this purpose?  Putting aside whether that's fair or not, is it even feasible?  How many people can be subsidized by the public and for how long?  More importantly, what happens to all those left behind in the poorer neighborhoods?  The strategy advocated in the article sounds more like an evacuation plan than a true housing plan.  The ""sinking ship"" neighborhoods are abandoned as we hustle a few lucky ones into life boats in affluent suburbs, is that it?

It simply produced vertical ghetto's where poverty was concentrated and local municipal services were either overwhelmed or inadequate. But one size doesn't fir all. Here in NYC public housing is generally closer to more varied municipal services like transportation and there are 260,000 applicants waiting to get into public housing.<br/><br/>This is simply a measure of how distorted the housing market is. Millions of people who work everyday at low wage jobs simply cannot afford market rate rents. Section 8 and similar government subsidies are one answer, but another is to re-think public housing. We've come a long way since the days of the Robert Taylor Homes in Chicago.

The city government undoubtedly would disagree, but we have more public money than we can shake a stick at.<br/><br/>Consider our street signs, for example. About 25-30 years ago, most of the small black-on-white street signs were replaced. Residents seemed content with the new ""BUSH"" or ""CLAY"" sign on every corner. Soon, however, it was decided that we needed much larger white-on-green signs – and that each should be placed in the middle of the block rather than at the corner. Thousands of green signs soon appeared. Next, perhaps because residents weren't sure which street a mid-block sign referred to, about 95% of the green signs were moved to the corners – often a foot away from the black-on-white sign that was already there.<br/><br/>But what self-respecting city could be content with ALL-CAPS street signs? No sooner had the large green signs been moved to corners than the city began replacing the small black-on-white street signs with signs that were identical but not in ALL-CAPS. On many corners, ""CLAY"" gave way to ""Clay.""	<br/><br/>Before this change-over was complete, however, it was decided that we might get by with all-caps white signs after all, and so this final sign-replacement program ended after only a thousand or so signs had been replaced.<br/><br/>In short, while Greece and California may have problems, at least one government won't be running out of money any time soon.",-0.9586
