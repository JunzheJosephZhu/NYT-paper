0,"I never thought I'd say this, but please bring back Mr. Friedman ... or allow people like him to write ahead of deadlines to avoid cramming in distinctly ""minor league"" (totally out of his depth) subs by way of writers &amp; columns.<br/><br/>One can't help looking for words like ""parody"" or ""humor"" in connection with a column like Mr. Bruni's - that's how lame it is.<br/><br/>He MUST be aware (or he needs to be given a sabbatical to bring him up to date with America since 2000) that the primary voters in the Republican party skew way more conservative than even the increasingly ""average"" Republican voter. Compare those million powerful individuals to people who call themselves independent or people objectively ""intelligent"" and decent and ... there's no comparison. It's always tough to deal with bullies and bigots - we used to smirk at Berlusconi; was he better or worse than George Wallace?<br/><br/>Anyhow, with 15 candidates vieing to be Repub. #1, none of them have the courage or decency to take on Trump as an obvious non-friend of the party, F. Bruni, ostensibly counsels. In Iowa or NH - um, isn't the great state of S. Carolina an early-ish, important primary prize? - ticking off a few thousand bigots requires more courage than most of the Republican piglets have. (That's not an insult - it's as if there are 10 teats on the money pig, and some of the runts will be short-lived.)<br/><br/>Who was it who tackled Joe McCarthy? A far more courageous and decent individual than any of those 15 - that's for sure!",0.9919
1,"The oft-repeated argument I hear is that Hillary is electable, but Bernie is not.  Yet if I recall correctly about eight years ago this was the same justification for supporting Clinton's candidacy.  The MSM was trumpeting the inevitability of her nomination then as well.<br/><br/>It is early enough, and support for Sanders is strong enough, that I think dismissing his candidacy as anything other than one that will be legitimately contesting the nomination may ultimately make one look foolish.   Did Obama look any stronger than Sanders this time eight years ago?<br/><br/>I think Hillary Clinton's best shot was 2007.  She has tremendous political capital (and financial), but support for her seems to be listless.  Her candidacy reminds me of two previous ones:  Robert Dole (the sentiment that it was ""his turn"" to be president) and Mitt Romney (too much politicking, too little substance).<br/><br/>I happened to be living in Iowa in 2008, and I caucused for Obama.  Believe me, most of us who voted for him didn't think we were voting for the next president then (after all, a Clinton nomination was inevitable).  But we felt that we were making a stand for something we believed in, and it felt good to be excited about that.",0.9836
2,"With the presidential election approaching, the article “Who Is Running for President (and Who’s Not)?” interested me. With two different political parties and opposing candidates, each individual holds their own views on political, economic and social aspects. Donald Trump is aspiring to become president in 2016. Trump is an outspoken individual and believes that he has a “foolproof” method to defeat the Islamic State. Although a very strong candidate, his outspoken personality and motifs deem him unpopular among some of the population. Hillary Clinton is a Democrat candidate running for president. If elected, Clinton hopes to focus on economic issues and reforms for the middle class, specifically women. She aspires to demand a higher minimum wage, paid family and medical leave, childhood education, and affordable childcare. Clinton faces intense criticism from her opposing Republican candidates. The retired governor of Florida, Jeb Bush is joining the Republican presidential nomination. Bush not only wants his campaign to gain him support from Republicans, but also conservatives who are distressed about electing a candidate. Bush holds the powerful belief that “America deserves better.” He supports reform in aspects of the economy and government. Due to extreme respect for the Bush family, a tremendous amount of Republicans support Jeb Bush. Overall, this article was very interesting because I admire how each candidate from either party holds their own views on the nation.",0.9832
3,"Well, we have zipped past Pluto and took some amazing pictures, and more good information will be coming.  A bonus for us and for the human race in this raging era of greed.<br/><br/>If Biden zips past Hillary another bonus for us and the world.  <br/><br/>I have always admired and trusted Biden.  Not only would he make a good president, he might bring out our better selves and instead of greed winning all the time, decency and honor might prevail.  ",0.9808
4,"With ""friends"" like these, who needs enemies?  As a close follower, loyal supporter and (small) contributor to Joe Biden since 2007, I am confident that:<br/><br/>1. Joe Biden is completely cognizant of his tendency to ""go off the ranch"" with the occasional errant comment-- I've seen him speak to this with great humor. To suggest that Biden is unaware of this trait insults the man and his political acumen, and ignores his repeated successes as Vice President, as a leader in the Senate, on the campaign trail, and in campaign debates.<br/><br/>2. As the veteran of two unsuccessful presidential campaigns and two successful runs on the Obama-Biden ticket, Biden is no doubt aware of the money and staffing needed to mount a successful national campaign.  I agree that he should not enter the race without substantial financing on hand.  He is already at a deficit vis a vis Clinton-- and even Sanders-- and will have to overcome this late start.  I have no doubt that Biden can and must assess accurately the magnitude of this deficit, which grows daily.<br/><br/>3. It insults Biden and the American public to suggest that his legacy will be diminished by a presidential run or as POTUS.  Biden is widely admired for good reason: a strong record in the White House and in the Senate; unwavering support for ordinary Americans; and a good heart.  He is better qualified than his challengers to assume the presidency and has broad bipartisan support.<br/><br/>If Biden runs, I am in his corner.  Joe: decide soon and well. ",0.9774

6,"""[Hillary's Democratic opponents] can move further to her left (Sanders, in particular, won’t have trouble doing so), but then their campaigns will seem even more quixotic.""<br/><br/>Not true, Ross. A majority of Americans support raising taxes on the wealthy, their effective tax rates are the lowest in decades. They are opposed to the disastrous Citizens United decision and support moving to public funding of elections. They believe that college has become unaffordable for many young people. They believe that climate change is occurring and that it is caused by human activity.<br/><br/>How Mainstream is Bernie Sanders?<a href=""http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/30463-how-mainstream-is-bernie-sanders"" title=""http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/30463-how-mainstream-is-bernie-sanders"" target=""_blank"">http://readersupportednews.org/opinion2/277-75/30463-how-mainstream-is-b...</a><br/><br/>""Sanders’s positions are quite mainstream from the point of view of the stances of the American public in general.

7,"While there are 17 Republican presidential candidates at present, sometime shortly after the first caucus or primary, one by one Republican candidates will begin announcing their withdrawal and the pundits will begin their count down to one (so they hope).  Problem is, it may not go that way at all.  There is so much money in the game (including The Donald's own) that a fair number may hold out to what might be a free for all at their convention.  And Donald Trump may just be the king maker of not the king by then.  <br/><br/>Trump will not make a third party run, because he wants to be king or king maker.  Running as an independent will remove him from the Republican fray and cost him fame and fortune.  I believe Mr. Trump will be at the convention, and Republicans with no clear winner may be forced to vote for him.  Everyone says he will not be the Republican nominee.  That is wishful thinking.<br/><br/>As for the ""debate"" commentators, that was Fox saying look at me, I can be legit.  The three played more like a beauty contest that a serious political event.  And they are right.  With so many Republicans with no chance in the running, playing as the circus that it currently is was the best way to get good ratings. <br/><br/>Donald Trump may well be the Republican nominee, and serious Republicans will be saying ""What do we do now?""   ",0.9739
8,"Sometimes age is a good thing--in those who've gained wisdom from experience, and have learned what's really important--such as serving a higher calling rather than their own personal ambition.  I heard Senator Sanders speak at a house party in West Branch, IA, and was electrified by his energy, charisma, charm and wit--as were all those assembled to hear him.  HIS AGE IS NOT AN ISSUE!  I repeat his response to the final questioner, for those cynics who can't imagine anything but business as usual.  The questioner stated agreement with all of Senator Sanders' views, but asked how he will implement them in the gridlocked Congress.  He responded, something to the effect, ""President Obama is a friend of mine.  And he ran a campaign that will go down in history for the way it engaged the grassroots. But President Obama made one mistake.  Once he was elected he said to all of you, 'Thanks.  I'll take it from here.'  The difference is that when I get elected, that's when your work will start.  I need all of your support and activism every day on every issue, so that when I am trying to convince Mitch McConnell to change position on a given issue, I can point out the window and say, 'See? All these people are with me.  You oppose me at your peril.'""",0.9734
9,"Hillary has a liability that seems unique among recent major candidates for president.  The more people know her the less they like her.  This was true in 2008, hence the Obama ""likeable enough"" comment in New Hampshire. This is the reason the Clinton campaign is loath to let her out on the stump except in the most controlled situation.  This may worked in a typical campaign season but as we are seeing the never ending campaign it is hard to image how her handlers can protect her long enough to lock up the nomination.  While see is certainly a big favorite against any currently announced democratic rival I am starting to think she is at best even money against a field which may include Biden and/or other well know democrats.",0.9715
10,"When Donald talks we all listen.  Why? Because he is appealing to our mind strings.   Most agree that he has awakened the dead.  We cannot but listen to the words that most are too insecure to say.  Our round table discussion today led to this result.  There is still no candidate that any of us wants to support.  We all respect Donald and agree with him on every count.  Is he Presidential??  And we all agree that if Trump selects Sarah Palin as his running mate, those on the fence will run for the hills.  Thumbs down  Hillary  we all  agreed.  She jumped into the race which prevented many a good candidate to sit on the sidelines.  It was agreed by all that the trust factor weighs heavily against Hillary. ",0.971
11,"I watched less than one minute of the debate, as I expected - from what little I saw - that the candidates would duck the hard questions and substantive issues.  But I trust Mr. Bruni, and I feel I learned from him all I need to know about the debate, and I learned in in far less than 2 hours.<br/><br/>Mr. Bruni made the astute observation that Fox News would be the best cable network to nail down the candidates on specific facts and issues.  I made (and hereby announce) this equally astute observation:  Fox News is the public relations arm of the Republican establishment.  Its purpose in making the debate meaningful is to weaken The Donald, leaving room for an establishment Republican to win the party's nomination.  The only wild care in the deck is. of course, The Donald, and I cannot see how Fox News can trump him.",0.9674
12,"Thanks to Ms. Dowd for artfully giving voice to the joy I feel at watching the republicans self-defeat once again as their really silly world view is outed by, yes, themselves. This campaign season looks both entertaining and easy for the Democrats. Of course they still have their own internal division to face twixt Sanders and Clinton. That could turn interesting as well.",0.9674
13,"Rubio, Walker and Bush all have considerable establishment support and good sugar daddies to keep them competitive.  So I can certainly see a scenario where they split the votes of all of those Republicans who are either establishment types themselves, or so eager for a win that they are willing to put up with one as their standard-bearer.  If so, then Trump will be competitive with them for delegates right up to the convention.  At which point, the establishment will settle on a candidate and Trump will be out.  What happens then is the REALLY interesting part.",0.967
14,"Trump's appeal is not at all because he is an outsider and the ""rage against the political establishment"". It is beyond question that if some other person who was different only in that he was an outsider would not be so far ahead of the others.<br/>The reason that he has all this support is because people want a leader. A highly competent man with confidence, charisma, decisiveness and a natural boss. This is what sets Putin apart and above other world leaders and why ""can he stand up to Putin"" is used as an example of a world class leader.<br/>In addition voters look at a candidate's life experience to determine his aptitude for being president. And being president is not about coming into office with promises about enacting certain policies. The presidency is a job. And that job is to manage all of the departments in the executive branch, to deal with the circumstances that he is dealt in the most effective way.<br/>And as opposed to politicians who presided over governments where things work out or not to various degrees and there is no clear test of competence, Trump has proven himself in building project upon project, all under budget and on schedule and making sure every last one of them functions effectively. And this if the type of background that people look for in a president.<br/>It has been a long time since there was a candidate that America cannot get enough of and commands more media coverage than all the other candidates combined. This is his appeal.",0.9634
15,"Finally, some promising news.  Time is of the essence, for in this country, the subtleties of the current situation in Syria (and beyond) are quite patently beyond the grasp of the current Republican Presidential candidates and, frankly, the Republican establishment.  Hopefully, enough progress will be made in spite of them and, again hopefully, before the possibility of electing any one of them into an Executive capacity in this country, since it seems a certainty that they will attempt to derail any agreement made by this Administration, if given the chance, no matter the merit of it. Good luck.",0.9524
16,"Indeed, there is a great opportunity for one or more of the Republican candidates to have a ""Sister Souljah moment.""  Be assured, however, that the gift has not been wasted -- at least not yet.  No doubt, Trump will provide another within the week.",0.9511
17,"Interesting that ""friends and associates"" are willing to present their sage advice about the ""downsides"" and negatives of a Biden run to a NYTimes reporter; yet, they are not so good, loyal, and genuine friends that they would express their concerns directly to wonderful Joe.  In my humble opinion, one can foresee big trouble for the Dems if Joe decides to challenge Hil.  The Republicans will clearly seize on the two candidates' membership in the Obama cabinet, and they'll have double the opportunity to amplify their attacks on the Obama presidency and handicap both candidates.  Better to provide Hil all the support she'll need than giving the GOP an opportunity ""gift"" to divide and conquer a fractured Democratic party. That's my humble advice, provided, of course,  through the good offices of the NYTimes.",0.9476
18,"Your focus on polls is missing the real point here.  The milquetoast candidates being served up by the RNC just are not appealing. It's the outsiders Trump, Cruz, Carson, Fiorina who are building excitement and getting all of the attention.  It's undeniable Trump is far ahead of everyone else but he doesn't even have a pollster working for him, he doesn't need one... You see his opinions are not ordained by polls like all of the career politicians he is beating. His opinions are his real vision of the things that will make America great again. <br/><br/>If you doubt his substance, Read Trumps books Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again and The America We Deserve, just two of dozens of books he's written over the 40 years of success in the private sector. If you think Trump isn't brilliant, let's see YOU go out and amass $10 billion. Bill Clinton certainly hasn't; even at $500,000 a speech. <br/><br/>Even in far left Socialist California, I talk to more and more Trump supporters every day. Few people talk of wanting another Clinton or the third Bush in the White House. Trump offers something for both the Right and the Left, and most people really aren't completely one way or the other. I kinda like the idea of him in the White House and the fear it will put into the Bureaucrats and Congressmen knowing he has a pad of pink slips and he's not afraid to use them.  Their lobbyists and K Street pals can't go in and save them either with Trump, he isn't taking any of their money. ",0.9474
19,"As much as I hate Trump, some of the things he has had to say do ring true.  Let me paraphrase:<br/>1.  Hedge fund managers should pay taxes on their income.<br/>2.  The wealthy should pay their fair share.<br/>3.  The middle class needs help.<br/>4.  When Trump gives funds to a politician, he expects to call the politician up and get something in return.<br/>5.  The other candidates are all puppets indebted to some billionaire sugar daddy. (Well, true, except for Bernie Sanders.)<br/>6.  The other Republican candidates are all lacking drive, imagination, intelligence, or all three.<br/><br/>When was the last time you heard statements that honest from a politician (again, other than Bernie Sanders)?<br/><br/>I, for one, am loving all of this because the conservative fat cats are sitting around in their country clubs or estates, hallucinating that the next French Revolution is coming and worrying that their fortunes will be taken away.  Oh, the next 14 months are going to be fun!",0.9468
20,"I don't know that Bernie can go the distance, but here's what's interesting about him:  when voters actually hear him, they come away impressed.  I agree that big money and the party machinery are in Hillary's and Jeb's camps, but that doesn't mean that voters are locked into those paradigms.<br/><br/>I'm betting that Bernie will do far better in Iowa and New Hampshire than the pundits predict.  He clearly stands up for the little guy, and that resonates with a lot of us.  Give 'em hell, Bernie!",0.9412
21,"Biden is more experienced and accomplished than Clinton in the art of governing.  His decades-long record in the U.S. Senate is far more substantive than hers, and his 6  years in the White House at least equal-- and perhaps exceed-- Clinton's 4  years as Secretary of State.  Biden is better prepared than any of his competitors to assume the presidency.<br/><br/>The sole areas in which Clinton outstrips Biden are in fundraising and attracting corporate support.  The Clintons have excelled in building a formidable campaign machine.  Biden has not.  This makes Clinton better positioned to win the presidenfy, but it does not better position her to govern.",0.9401
22,"The Jeb announcement got me thinking how dramatically things have change during my lifetime. When Prescott was the senator from Connecticut Jeb's foreign policy advisers and that part of the party which is very much Jeb's based would have been too Jewish and too intellectual for Republican politics. William F Buckley's bete noire were Libertarians were too Jewish and too intellectual for anything but the extreme outer limits of American politics and today well there is hardly a jew or an intellectual found anywhere in Ron Paul's segment of the GOP. Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Rick Perry and Lindsey Graham would have been Dixiecrats, Chris Christie, George Pataki and Jeb Bush would be mainstream Northeastern Republicans. Scott Walker would represent the Joseph McCarthy midwest faction of the GOP Santorum would have been a Democrat and Jindal, Carson and Fiorina just didn't look enough like Robert Young. I don't know if this is what progress looks like but it is very interesting. Rubio of course would have been in the Havana white House running things for us.",0.9399
23,     I can name 5 Republicans running for President but I can't name a single reason why any of them are running except that they want to be President or get a gig on Fox.<br/><br/>      Krugman is right.  Clinton may be able to win the Presidency but it's very unlikely her skirt tails will allow the Democrats to win the House.  <br/><br/>      Bernie Sanders is the only candidate who appears driven by a need for fundamental change in America instead of personal ambition.,0.9349
24,"I don't know, Maureen.  I think you missed the real story:  the phone call from the Big Dog to Trump back in May.  What was said, do you think?  Some sly deal between them to help Hillary win?  An eventual run as an independent?  Is that what Bill suggested in that call? I wonder what he promised Trump.<br/><br/>At least Trump didn't go on and on about god like the rest of the wanna-be theocrats.  They scare me most of all.  Huckabee is a downright lunatic.<br/><br/>The ticket that worries me is Bush/Kasich.   Florida/Ohio.  More 'compassionate conservatism'.  It'll probably be what finishes us off.  All us poor people, I mean.  But Bush really is not living up to the Big Boys Game it seems.  Kasich, another wannabe theocrat may be on top with Rubio. Ohio/Florida.  <br/><br/>It's Kasich I don't like.  Hillary should be worried about Kasich.  <br/><br/>So, I wonder what the Big Dog said.  And I hope Trump mounts a third party bid.  For all our sakes. ",0.9314
25,"Clinton and Biden make the case very strongly, for Sanders. <br/><br/>It's a tragedy that a gaff prone sympathy case and an anointed corporate tool can push a superbly honest, brilliant, man of the people like Sanders off the stage. Does this have to be a celebrity contest? Can't we elect a person for their devotion and integrity? <br/><br/>I'll vote for the Democrat to keep right wingers out of office.

28,"I see the NYT's has joined all the other major media by consistently leveling the snark cannon at Bernie whenever the opportunity presents itself. He must be a serious concern and all the more reason to support him. This is the quant snark angle. <br/><br/>The overarching reality is that it is way too soon to predict any candidate. The correlation between anyone leading at this point and their nomination and eventual election is almost nil. This article mentions this no where. Nor does it mention momentum (measured as rate of increase of support/time) which actually is correlated with winning elections. It doesn't even project out the numbers that are presented, which is a tacit acknowledgement of their (lack of) value.<br/><br/>The underlying message is, ""Bernie Sanders can't win, so don't bother listening to him.

30,"The rise of ""the media"" has given rise to populism and the Republicans have become adept at manipulating populism.  Scott's political ascendancy is witness to this phenomenon.  But the appropriate response is not more populism, it's less.  The dominance of ""the media"" may prevent a more adequate response, which will leave the Dems in a relatively untenable position come election time.  The Dems need to get smarter.  Scott's political rise may be a real warning, not to be dismissed with easy labels.  Populism gave us Obama and Biden--to my mind a good thing, especially in light of the alternatives--but it may also give us Walker and his puppeteers (I know! I know!  It's a label).",0.9162
31,"I LOVE this poll - 63% of Republican voters prefer someone not named Bush.

As Jeb grows increasingly desperate and begins tacking even more sharply to the right in order to rescue his (and his family's) ""political honor"" it becomes clear that we are heading for a reprise of 2012.",0.9149
32,"I am an independent who strives to be open minded about candidates on both the right and the left.  While I agree that Rubio, Kasich and Walker probably came through on the high end of the scale in last night's debate I was grateful to the commentators for their pointed questions.  Walker has fallen off of my 'possible' choices by virtue of his extreme position on abortion, (e.g., let the mother die to save the baby).  And I really admired Kasich's response the question about how he would react if one of his daughters told him she is gay.<br/><br/>FOX has set a new bar for informative debate dynamics.

34,"Perhaps our erstwhile TV moderators for the next GOP debates will be replaced by you!!!  <br/><br/>Part of the reason that their comments were as they were is because Fox people did a crummy job of bringing up the important issues of our time.  <br/><br/>Gun control.  Climate change.  Import-Export bank.  Cost of education.    etc.  etc.  etc.<br/><br/>They at Fox did what they are really good at.

40,"Wanted gift""? Au contraire, D. Trump is an extraordinarily accurate portrait of Republicans in 2015.<br/><br/>He isn't denounced in uncertain terms by other would-be Republican presidential nominees for one simple reason: Trump echos the sentiments of Republican voters! He is now ranked 2nd among the announced candidates, for example. Trump's sentiments are precisely those of  most registered Republicans. Perhaps the columnist would like to imagine that Republicans represent some other rational minority, or majority, but they don't.<br/><br/>The only real debate in the pre-presidential contest is Clinton vs Sanders. Recall when Wm Clinton represented the faux Republicans circa 1992 and was elected by a minority thanks to the 3rd party candidacy of Perot (19% of the vote). The game of musical chairs among Republicans in 2015 is just that: a game unrelated to finding good answers to a whole series is overwhelming problems, social, economic, environmental, diplomatic.

Goal #1 achieved. Goal #2? Trump was put to ""tough"" questions to demonstrate how the three hosts were journalists, not Murdoch Minions and to help the GOP owners in their attempt to diminish or destroy the Trumpenstein the Party itself has created. Goal at least partially achieved, thanks to the predictable post-event Trump attack on poor, defenseless Megyn Kelly.

Sanders is the only candidate that sees this consensus weakening and is truly rising against it.

377,"What troubled me most was not the disruption (an important tool for the disadvantaged) but the lost opportunity to build a real discussion at that moment. The language from the podium was bombastic and accusatory, and casting Sanders (and the audience) as a representative of ""whiteness"" seems to me be a kind of profiling, that is, a kind of racism. But then, we can't all be ML King when we get the microphone in our hands. ",-0.7495
378,"I will preface this comment by saying I think Trump's public persona, both in business and politics, is clownish...to put it kindly.<br/><br/>That said, there is no shortage of arrogant narcissists and just plain nasty people at the highest levels of politics. Trump is different in that the pomposity and belligerence are a forward part of his personal brand. <br/><br/>The example of Bill Cosby isn't completely apropos but Washington is full of similar people: esteemed public figures who are revealed as horrible human beings when you see behind the veil.

381,"Doubtful that any Republicans will make the predicted comparisons of HR Clinton to Nixon. They would just as soon never hear mention of him, as they would of GW Bush. But the two upcoming books will give impetus, at least among journalists and pundits, to describe what is most common about them, where they are alike behaviorally and where their campaigns are historically comparable. As Bruni notes, in common as well is the antipathy, the unease or even repugnance (more so about Nixon) that voters have felt about Clinton and Nixon, a  resignation to an end-justifies-the means rationale; although, we all know where that kind of thinking can lead.<br/><br/>The resignation of many Democrats to Clinton's nomination is also reminding of how many Democrats felt about their nominees in the second-term campaigns against both Reagan and GW Bush. Mondale and Kerry both seemed like awkward old-school party hacks with little personal appeal, no common touch, and no imagination. Who among average voters really thought either could win?<br/><br/>Clinton also can seem like a hack because of that assumption of inevitability, that her contributions have well-oiled the machine and its levers are hers to pull. This was also true of Nixon, but of course he was clearly nefarious.<br/><br/>Outside of experience, what Clinton has going for her is the collection of unqualified, unstable, pathetic, and bizarre GOP candidates.

Megyn Kelly seems to be the only one confronting him directly, yet her responsible journalism seemed little-highlighted after Trump's childish all-night tweeting tantrum and hideous remarks.

391,"Clearly, Maureen Dowd is a sycophant for Trump. She fears him, his words, and part of her is attracted to his take-no-prisoners approach to public and private life.

Bush has it right when he objects to Trump's ""tone."" He does not object to his message, which is the same message of his cohort of clowns running for the nomination for President. The difference between Dowd and Bush is that Dowd finds the petty, thin-skinned, and vindictive Trump ""entertaining,"" while Bush considers him a ""jerk."" The American public truly are ""losers"" in the Trump vernacular, if they take any of this circus seriously. NY Times readers are particularly ill-served by the ""go ahead to get ahead"" ramblings of Dowd.<br/>Dowd, Trump, Bush, and the other clowns make Barack Obama, Hilary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders look like paragons of the public square, which, measured by comparison to the train wreck that is the Republican party, they are.",-0.8591

The mainstream media has been far too cowed (or bought?) to fight back against the barrage of lies with a real discussion of issues.

Murdoch accomplished this by lying to and terrorizing a large segment of working, white Americans.  <br/><br/>Now Trump has come along and is out demogoguing the demagogue.  Trump says in plain English things that Murdoch could only dog whistle, and the terrified far right voters are flocking to Trump. <br/><br/>To counter this, at the first debate, broadcast on Fox, Murdoch sent out a team, led by a woman, to make a well planned attack on Trump.

Donald Trump and time for the rot to do its work have caught up with what Ailes and Murdoch engineered.  <br/><br/>They nurtured an angry, disaffected, anti-intellectual, nativist party -- a party of resentment that middle-aged white guys without a good education don't have a better future than people who don't look like them ... but do.

Immigration reform, however, requires nuance because there ARE harsh realities in deporting people.  That doesn't mean it shouldn't be done, necessarily, but it can't be done in the flippant callous manner in which Trump likes to do and say things.  It will also require cooperation from the Mexican to control immigration going forward.  Trump has essentially poisoned the well before his would-be Presidency has even begun by making repeated references to a conspiracy to flood U.S. streets with criminals.  This is just ONE of many examples demonstrating that Trump is not fit for diplomacy with foreign nations.  During his Presidency, Trump will not be able to simply fire other world leaders who disagree with him.  Whole races of people are not going to simply accept insults from our highest office without political consequences.  Our country's financial problems (unlike Trump's personal financial problems, evidently) cannot be solved through repeated bankruptcy applications.
