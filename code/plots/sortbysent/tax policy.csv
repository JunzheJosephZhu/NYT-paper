0,"I admit this is tax wonky, but it doesn't make sense to tax income attributed to a ""carried interest"" partnership investment any different from that attributed to a passive partnership investment (i.e., the current law makes the most sense--the tax characterization depends on the nature of the underlying income, not the ""type"" of partner you are).<br/><br/>However, it does make sense to tax the grant of the ""carried interest"" partnership interest as a tax realization event subject to ordinary income treatment.  The issuance of the carried interest ""profits interest"" is currently not taxed because it's ""out of the money"" and ""too indeterminate"" to value, although clearly in the aggregate this is a huge amount of compensation being tax free when you think of every partnership formed with a carry (from a restaurant LLC to a real estate investment fund).  <br/><br/>The simplest solution is to tax the grant retroactively after the profits interest becomes subject to a reasonably ascertainable value--after a liquidation event or when distributions start to look like an annuity.  You just go back and time and value the profits interest grant with full knowledge of its investment performance using a simple DCF analysis.  Then you apply some additional interest to compensate the IRS for the deferral.  In the end, only the winning investments are worth anything and pay tax.  And in the aggregate, the exact right amount of tax is applied by those who were granted securities in exchange for services.  ",0.9982
1,"For Greece, or any city, state, or nation (or any family) to support and sustain a Republic, Democracy, Theocracy, Capitalism, Communism, Fascism, Dictatorship, Kingdom, Principality or any other form of government that they select and/or is imposed upon them, that nation still has to have their privately owned businesses continuously create sufficient new taxable national wealth (and jobs) in their nation so that there is enough available wealth in that nation for that nation's government to confiscate a portion of that new taxable national wealth and/or profit that was created by the private sector businesses plus additional amounts confiscated through income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, tariffs, etc., and other taxes by the government tax collectors to pay for their wealth consuming government activities.<br/><br/>This can only be accomplished by limiting government spending to less than the government collects in taxes!<br/><br/>Hopefully this can be done by each government without borrowing wealth from individuals and governments  (mostly in other nations who buy that nation’s Sovereign Treasury Bonds) to pay for their various wealth consuming government activities including any distribution of wealth confiscated from the wealth creators and then handed to the tax supported citizens.

2,"It seems we are jumping in the middle of the argument instead of going back to ask the most basic questions:  What do we think a retired person should expect and who should supply it.  While there are surely risks we all take over the course of our working lives with our potential retirement that make everyone's retirement picture look different (job choices, savings levels, spending choices, children, etc.), is there really anyone who believes a retired person should not have access to affordable healthcare and some minimal assured income component?<br/><br/>In a country as rich as ours, isn't it essentially immoral for a child or a retired person (both frequently having no alternatives as they can not necessarily work) to forgo basic medical help because they can not afford it.  The same could be said of retirement income, which SS appropriately pays based on taxes paid into the program in the past making it somewhat meritocratic.  No retired person is getting rich on SS and Medicare will not cover everything, but surely it provides the bare minimum we should expect.<br/><br/>If privatizing was more effective (better coverage/outcome for the money), I would support it.  However, gambling an assured government program on a highly uncertain privatized one seems unreasonable.  When we look at who benefits (insurance companies &amp; stock brokers) I see why they want it, but fail to see how they make it more effective or efficient by adding a middleman too!  ",0.979
3,"""We need to rescue the country from the corporate interests that have engineered the extremities in wealth inequality and the preferences in the tax code.

4,"Well, one thing that can be said about tax cuts for very rich people, from the view point of those very rich people, is that they get to keep more of the boodle, and make more on the boodle they keep, as a result of said tax cuts.  Take the Koch Brothers, whose combined net worth borders on a $100 billion dollars, and assuming a modest annual return 6% per annum return on capital (interest, diviendends, and capital gains), that means each brother starts with about no less than 2 to 3 billion dollars a year in unearned income, on top of which comes their salaries as executives for Koch Industries and service on various boards of directors.  Get rid of the estate tax, and the Kochs can pass their billions tax free to their heirs; create a flat tax and the Kochs pay only pocket change in tax for their annual income.  So the Kochs and their friends think tax cuts are the greatest thing since slice bread and make sure the whole Republican Party thinks so to! ",0.9697
5,"I believe that Mr. Edsall is incorrect when he writes that ""trade, taxes and social spending are subjects that have not yet achieved progressive consensus and retain the potential to fracture the [Democratic] party.""  The 2016 election is already shaping up as a critical contest between two diametrically opposed visions of America, particularly regarding taxes and social spending: the Republicans want to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations and dismantle major parts of the safety net (i.e., Social Security, Medicare, Obamacare, etc.); and the Democrats want everyone to pay their ""fair share"" of taxes (which means increase taxes for the wealthy and corporations) and strengthen and secure the safety net. If the Republicans win the presidency and retain their majorities in the House and Senate then the already deleterious polarization that is tearing this country apart will reach a critical point.

6,"The Republicans must have a cause, a purpose, that they can sell to these major donors to get them to open their checkbooks. Hammering those who make less money is the facile course. The oligarchs look down up the workers and see them as unworthy, unwashed and uncultured cheats. They imagine that they, the rulers and owners, made a rich, successful nation on their own. They cast themselves as heroes in a drama of their own imagination, forgetting the collective contributions of the nation and the real risks of injury and death many workers took to build an economy and our nation.<br/><br/>The Great Recession of 2008 sprang in large measure from new methods to transfer wealth from the economic middle class to those with excess capital. Cheap, easy loans would, it was hoped, produce long paying, 30 yr. mortgages that would pay and pay. Then, the management class, those who work for the mega-rich, got too fancy and turned junk loans into triple A securities and the cards tumbled down. So, new ways to transfer wealth upward must, always, be found.<br/><br/>Cutting govt. spending might, at best, knock 100K off the taxes of someone taking in 10 million per yr. Never mind. A man can dream, can't he? The idea is to stop future threats to the wealthy, to ""starve the beast"" so that wealth and power continue to accrue to the most wealthy, and their progeny, for now and ever more. Then, the earthly paradise would be complete.<br/><br/>Hey, once you have everything, there are still things to fight for.",0.9628
7,"Yes, fighting the Derp of constant demands for self interested proposals which are based on dishonest analysis is key.<br/><br/>Which derp is the most important?  Well, the first thing the conservatives did when they took over the congress last month was to demand drastic reductions in inheritance taxes.  Currently, only rich people (inheritance over $500,000) pay inheritance or death taxes.<br/><br/>This is similar to rich people's constant demands for lower income taxes.  But inheritance gets less publicity, possibly because few people pay any inheritance taxes while most voters and media audiences pay income tax.<br/><br/>Thomas Jefferson outlawed extreme inheritance in Virginia because it gave too much power to the individual who inherited extreme wealth.  This has become ingrained in our culture.  We now expect all the children in a family to share the inheritance, not only the eldest son.  <br/><br/>Some societies destroy the wealth of their richest people upon death for the same reason.  The book Origins of Inequality from Harvard University Press, as well as Piketty's book on capital, give  discussions in death of concentration of wealth and the growth of inequality both 20,000 years ago and today.<br/><br/>The derpish claim that inheritance taxes are harmful is the opposite of the truth, and is possibly the most important piece of derp around.  We do not need more Koch brothers, not to mention King Georges.  <br/><br/>Go to YouTube and watch Comedy Party Platform (2 min 9 sec) to see what to do.  ",0.9624
8,"As to actual policies of JEB! administration (or Walker, etc.), they will probably be what Paul Ryan has proposed: huge tax cuts for the very wealthy (abolition of estate tax, capital gains tax, tax on dividends, reduction of corporate rate to 23%, reducing the income top rate);  austerity for non-defense spending and privatization of Government functions and employment (no investment infrastructure, public education, or research R&amp;D); repeal of environmental and public health protections; expand the U.S. role in its current Middle Eastern wars (which will probably drive up the price of oil); generally spend a lot on Defense while cutting the social insurance programs of  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and repealing the Affordable Care Act; and finally appoint John Taylor or someone like Taylor who believes that real interest rates need to be higher.  Absent the ""confidence fairy"" and ""tax cut fairy"" creating some sort of bubble, this set of policies, particularly the high interest rate and war in oil producing countries policies, is not likely to set off a growth explosion, likely the opposite.

10,"""The superrich are always with us (or on top of us)""<br/><br/>But, for a time, before Republicans persuaded ordinary people that the rich couldn't be taxed at 90%, any longer, lest they cease to invest. Clearly, this is the same as saying that the rich would refuse to continue to be rich, despite all evidence to the contrary. For example, in the '50's, TIME wrote that Barbara Hutton, the heiress to the Woolworth's fortune, had a tax-free annual income of $2,000,000, when that was a lot of money. She did this by investing the bulk of her inheritance into tax-free municipal bonds. Municipal bonds pay so little interest that they're usually bought only by the 1% as a tax-dodge. These days, there's no need for the rich to invest in the maintenance and repair of the national infrastructure as a way of avoiding ""punitive"" taxation. They're free of any taxation worth bothering about, to begin with. ",0.9537

13,"Tom:<br/><br/>Although you didn't mention him in your op-ed, I noticed that a candidate named Bernie Sanders is running. He seems to have a few ideas we haven't heard for a while such as the idea that a country that is wealthy enough to spend $1.4 Trillion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (that is, about $4,000 for every man, woman, and child in America) is also rich enough to provide a free public college education to all who want it. Or that a country that can spend north of $4 Trillion ($12,000 per capita) blowing up Afghanistan and Iraq is wealthy enough to also provide health care to all of its citizens.<br/><br/>He's also got some good ideas about campaign finance reform, ensuring everyone has work, preserving retirement savings, and the like.<br/><br/>Honestly, there's no reason to cry ""None of the above"" this time.",0.9349

Taxpayers paid the rest.  The only one who hit the jackpot was the one with credit life insurance who suddenly died of a massive heart attack and the credit life policy paid off the house.  There was no evidence of heart disease in this person at the time he purchased the credit life policy.  When the portfolio of those FHA 235s was re-examined, many had their subsidies cut substantially, one of whom was only to receive $7.50 per month subsidy after the re-evaluation.
