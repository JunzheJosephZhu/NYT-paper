0,"I am not a ""leading Democrat,"" so I see the e-mail ""issue"" as just an insidious campaign to undermine the reputation and political path of an extremely insightful, talented, dynamic woman whose liberal political platform could really help working families and women. I'm sure Mrs. Clinton -  as a hard-working Secretary of State who cared a great deal about human rights -  was as conscientious and careful about her e-mail communications as any human being could be. Besides, plenty of so-called classified government data doesn't need to be classified. Much classified information is either not important or already public. And with all the sensitive information released courtesy of Wiki-leaks and Edward Snowden, and with rivals like Russia and China hacking away at us as fast as they can, is anything, anywhere really secret anymore? This e-mail ""story"" is like a woodpecker incessantly pecking at a tree. We who believe it is our turn to have a woman in the White House - one who is both brilliant and a Democrat -  should not take it seriously or be distracted by it. ",0.9773
1,"Thank you Prof. Tufekci for this terrific piece and thank you to the NYT for giving it space.  I have largely avoided FB for just the privacy reasons you mentioned, but I am unlike other posters who think the answer is just ""don't use social networks"".  That attitude misses the point that these sites are obviously providing people with useful ways to connect with friends, causes and services, or they would not be so popular. I have been kvetching privately to friends for years that I would be happy to pay a small amount to pay for the programmers, cloud storage, etc if FB or Google would give me the option.  It may be that ""Rick Starr"" is right that the network effect will continue to overwhelm demand for privacy. But he may be wrong, and there could be an upstart competitor somewhere (probably somewhere in Europe) who appreciates this neglected side of the market working right now to eat FB's lunch.  For others who like this idea, you might be interested in a Planet Money podcast that covers some of the same ground (Episode 568, Snoops, Hackers and Tin Foil Hats).  ",0.9747
2,"Quid pro quo. You want full, free electronic access to a well respected news source, but them trying to help you find news you will like (and therefore stay on the site, come back soon, and perhaps click an advertisement that pays for the resource you are consuming) is some affront to your privacy?<br/><br/>I'm glad to see they are creating an opt-out option, but the tone of your message is a bit preposterous. If this is your true view. perhaps you should go buy a print copy and read it anonymously. ",0.969
3,"Cell phones were a godsend for the traditional phone companies. Just as long distance was becoming cheaper than cheap, they were able to get people to pay by the minute for local calls, something that people almost never had to do previously with landlines. <br/><br/>By the way, if you want to get angry about govt. give aways to the rich, note this: every traditional phone company was given, free of charge, use of airwaves for one full cellular phone system at the start of the cell era. That was worth billions of dollars, one reason that the rich always get richer because the govt. often helps them along. Welfare for the wealthy.<br/><br/>Another note: television stations are being asked to sell airwaves, spectrum, back to the govt. so it can be re-sold for cell expansion. Those television stations get the spectrum for free.",0.9686
4,"More change for the sake of profits.  I am a very effective Windows user.  I can program multiple languages (including assembler!), do database development, and can create complex spreadsheets with the best of them.<br/><br/>When windows came out with their ""ribbon"" interface, it was so frustrating that I had to track down an add-in to emulate the old interface.  I had no time or patience to learn the new interface.  Access I actually still use a pre-ribbon version of, since I found no add in for that product.<br/><br/>Next, I needed a machine with Windows Server recently.  The new OS interface is perplexingly different from an effective standard interface like 2008 R2.<br/><br/>So all said, I am probably what's considered a Windows power user, but I have come to detest the changes they make for the sake of lining their pockets, and if I could do my enterprise computing with an Apple machine (sadly, I can't) I would change platforms in a heartbeat.  At least OS X looks and acts like a real OS, and not like the interface for some game machine where you have to use help or the internet to locate how to do the most basic maintenance functions.  Microsoft, I hope you are reading this...",0.9631

The Company that Made It would like you to Think so<br/><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/technology/addicted-to-your-smartphone-the-company-that-made-it-would-like-you-to-think-so.html?smid=tw-nytimes"" title=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/technology/addicted-to-your-smartphone-the-company-that-made-it-would-like-you-to-think-so.html?smid=tw-nytimes"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/technology/addicted-to-your-smartphone...</a><br/><br/>This article  caught the interest of my eyes this week because it’s true. Many people are addicted to their smartphones, including myself. From the time we wake up to the time we go to sleep we are constantly checking our phones, even if we didn't get a text or call, it’s becoming a habit to constantly check. In the article it mentioned how Microsoft and Nokia had came out with ads that stated how windows phones are better than iphones because it will help you get away from your phone more. I think this is a good idea because a lot of people that I know have iphones and are constantly on it because it’s just a simpler phone to use, and everyone has one. This article was also able to catch my interest because it was able to suggest ways to stay away from your phones. One suggestion that was mentioned that I do, is turning on my “do not disturb” and my friends get very mad at times when I do so, because I don't answer their text messages right away.<br/>	 I think it’s important to say that we may need to disconnect ourselves from it here and there that way there’s more face to face communication rather than just looking down at a screen all day.

6,"Is there a way our society could ask/persuade young people like this girl to really do something useful and beneficial for others as well as for herself ?<br/>Having to earn one's living through honest work used to be a more compelling purpose in life.<br/>Instead, we give social media the upper hand in distorting such vulnerable people's minds and allegiances. We should have the willingness to flag, filter and shutdown such accounts and communication, especially since they seem to  be known .  It is OUR right to live, work, provide for our families and uphold OUR values and WE are unwilling to give them up. ",0.9593
7,"My wife and I are currently traveling around Southeast Asia for six months.  I'm American and my wife is from Belgium (where we live).  I would say that it's much easier to keep yourself connected than this article suggests.  <br/><br/>In the EU, depending on the country you are in, you can simply buy a SIM card from many different providers.  This also includes grocery stores, like Carrefour, aka 'French Wal-Mart,' that will sell pre-paid cards, usually without any need to register the card.   <br/><br/>As many commenters have said, the EU is  pushing mobile carriers to lower their roaming rates meaning that if you're traveling multiple countries, you should be able to use your 'Euro-SIM' phone anywhere within the EU.  <br/><br/>What we have been doing here in Southeast Asia is a bit different.  We brought along a spare, unlocked phone and in each country we've visited, we bought a prepaid SIM under a plan that was optimized for data.  We put the SIM in the spare phone and, once configuring it, we turn on the 'mobile hotspot function' and voila!  We have Wi-Fi everywhere! <br/><br/>This way, we're always connected to the internet (assuming there's an 2G/3G signal) and can not only stay in touch, but can also sync our photos in real time as well as crucially, use the navigation function on our main phones in case we get lost. I wrote a post about it on my blog (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/psjz4ma"" title=""http://tinyurl.com/psjz4ma"" target=""_blank"">http://tinyurl.com/psjz4ma</a> ..shameless plug).  In any case, research plans that best suit you beforehand and you'll be fine.  Happy travels!",0.9564
8,"Collecting data to sell to advertisers as the main vehicle for profit is only one ""evil.""<br/><br/>The two most dangerous perpetrators, in potential, are Facebook and Google for the undue influence they have the potential of having on unsuspecting users. We found out a year ago about two experiments Facebook ran on user timelines by manipulating what came through their feeds. <br/><br/>In a political season where the system will be awash with cash, real cash, the potential for Facebook to take further advantage and ignore the most basic of ethics is real. With no watchdog, save for a few conscientious professors of journalism like Jay Rosen of NYU to speak out, the public is likely to be manipulated again.<br/><br/>While I am concerned about the creepy nature of ads that mirror web browsing I just did independently of Facebook, I am far more concerned about the ability of Facebook to manipulate an election, or to reap far greater financial gain from manipulating the placement of news items to the highest media and political bidders.<br/><br/>We are at a time of political peril. Money in politics isn't only the vast amounts political candidates are able to raise, but its mirror opposite: what they can buy with that money. With the FEC and other bodie pretty much de-fanged, a Supreme Court that clearly sides with moneyed plutocratic, theocratic forces, and a corporate media that is supposed to police itself, who and what is a citizen to believe? <br/><br/>We need regulation of social media. Citizens United must end.",0.9518
9,"This story only gives one sentence to what is the real story here.<br/><br/>""The court document describes how two F.B.I. employees, posing as supporters of the terrorist group, engaged the couple in a long online courtship in which they repeatedly stated their desire to join the militants.""<br/><br/>What kind of courtship? What exactly did it consist of? Did their own government radicalize these kids in order to entrap them? How did the government identify them? Was it through NSA surveillance? What social media platforms were being monitored? Would these children have done this without the encouragement and help of their FBI handlers? How serious were they before the FBI got involved? Was a passing interest and flirtation turned into more by the FBI’s courtship? Why did the FBI court them instead of just watch them? Did the FBI have an obligation to inform their parents? I know they were over 18 but they were hardly mature adults. Will they get a fair trial or will it be cloaked in secrecy? What if they were your kids?<br/><br/>This story raises many questions I hope we get some answers.",0.9473
10,"Putting an instruction to ""Do not disturb!"" into a card is easier than putting account-identifying information onto a credit or debit card.  The cards don't even need to be different from room to room to work as well as human readable cards, either.  The ones we have now pretty much all say the same thing, anyway!<br/><br/>So, don't say I didn't warn you.  A robot equipped with the proper 'reader' just needs to get in the proximity of the card, same as most corporate security badges, and it will be able to comply with a guest's wishes.  (I'll bet the robot even 'remembers' to check back later, when the room should likely be available.)<br/><br/>But, better yet, guests won't need to hang a card.  They can, via the hotel's Intranet, simply schedule maid, laundry, and room service via their laptop, smartphone, or tablet.  The hotel's central computer system can, in turn, update the kitchen, laundry, or roving robots with new requests.",0.9455
11,"To be honest the US government, and western nations in general, are between a rock and a hard place. The best IT people can make a much better salary working in the private sector than for their governments. That's not the case in China, and Russia, and other East Bloc countries, where a blind eye is directed towards cyber criminals who support the status quo, or IT employees of the government which offers very rewarding benefits.<br/><br/>Moving forward, I agree with Richard Clarke, a controversial intelligence expert in both the Bush 1 and Clinton administration, that we need a unique department with a cyber-security ""Czar"" as part of our homeland security program.",0.945

13,Funny then that Colin Powell had a server at home and a private email address.

14,"Some of you who are smart-watch-curious should check out the sub-$100 Pebble watch. It links seamlessly to your Iphone or Android, and, while not as fancy as the Apple watch, still buzzes when calls or emails come in, shows weather, and location, etc. and is much more discreet and watch-like.

16,"This is the Tinder generation.  It's impossible to really get to know someone if you won't talk to them on the phone, don't respond to texts in a timely manner, don't know how to interact when another person when you meet them in person, and move on from them in thirty minutes or after one date.  Or, as is often the case, flake completely after agreeing to meet with them. Or spend your time with them checking your phone every five minutes because your addicted to it and care more about it than almost any human being in the world, except perhaps for your mother (I said perhaps).<br/><br/>But seriously, it's not just the mindset, as Lori aptly noted earlier -- Lori, are you single?  :) -- it's the lack of manners, common decency, and common sense.  Even is a world of abundance and almost infinite choices, we should be slowing down at certain points and treating other people with more seriousness, more respect, and more decency than many of the millennials do now.

17,"It's a bit disconcerting to read all these comments. As a 21 year old who's grown up completely divulged in the realm of the interconnected web, I know what's out there. Yes, some, if not most of the web and its content can be a bit idle, but it's spawning services that will one day be so deeply rooted in our every day life that we wonder how we ever lived without.

18,"Of course it's disturbing that hackers could take over your car, or even your home appliances once we have a true Internet of Things.  But have we consumers given much thought to privacy from the manufacturers?  I have just been informed by Honeywell that my new thermostat cannot be operated via wifi unless I agree to the monitoring of my times of use, temperatures selected, etc., no opt-out available.  The terms and conditions even refer to ""personalized"" data collection, whatever that means, as well as Big Data collection.   I do not wish to share this information.  I don't want Honeywell to know when I go to bed, or when I am on vacation.  It's one thing to be tracked for using an otherwise free service, such as Google searches, but another to be monitored for something I have paid for outright.  Also, this tracking reaches right into my home, whereas the other forms of monitoring at least concern communications with the outside, plus allow opt-outs.

19,"One of my children, a younger and relatively healthy person, moved to another state this year. Unemployed for a time, he was told that he was eligible for low-cost coverage through one of the state's exchanges, so he went to the state's website and created an account. Some time later, having not heard a thing from this entity, he called its telephone number, only to be told that he had missed a deadline that had been communicated to him not via the personal email address that he had provided, but only through a message directed to his account on its website. How smart does one have to be to realize that most people furnishing their email addresses will expect to be contacted via that address, and not through some proprietary site that they have visited only once?

20,"""Executives of these companies genuinely believe that over the long run, information technology — including, naturally, the services they themselves provide — is crucial to bettering society."" I don't know why none of the comments addresses this vital point by the author - and how vitally wrong he is. FB &amp; Google are out to make a buck. They would rather gobble each other for profit than work with each other to be as virtuous as the author suggests. The sad thing is, it makes their trumpeted virtue true double-speak.

They use these rights to force cable companies to also force their other channels into the lower tier TV packages, driving up what all homes pay for the programming.<br/><br/>As these costs rise, many households drop video subscriptions, leaving fewer paying customers to cover the nut.<br/><br/>Also, as consumers turn to online video, that drives up the costs of delivering broadband.<br/><br/>In the end, I think people would be a lot more relaxed about cable company monopolies if they weren't pay more every year for TV and Broadband.

191,"My household has challenged absurd, easily debunked, viral emails which has resulted in being removed from the email lists, which is positive.  Unfortunately, I have no doubt they continue to be sent as debunking has resulted in zero acknowledgment of the childish falseness of said emails, rather anger or ignoring corrections is the reaction.  Still, it is the right thing to do, and I find that I cannot keep my mouth shut if I hear such comments.  It is frightening though to realize that presented facts do not penetrate the senders.

That's the whole point of this problem. She ignored protocol. I know others abused the system, but she is running for POTUS. I was all for her in 2008, but not anymore.",-0.9244

Will the US government tell you?<br/><br/>As the hackers build databases, so too they build queries (questions/viewpoints) about the data, and that allows them to build a structured vocabulary of knowledge about Americans that we don't know about our friends, neighbors, even ourselves.<br/><br/>The motive is unscrupulous and criminal, or worse. They could use any terrorist organization as a proxy fighting force, give them personal details about you and I and set them loose inside our borders.<br/><br/>Nothing too scary, right?",-0.9489
195,"Here's the criminal investigation's focus: The Top Secret satellite info and other highly classified info could not have been emailed to Hillary Clinton from the secure rooms where they are viewed. These rooms are not connected to the regular internet, they're shielded, and no one is allowed to remove any info on thumb drives or down their pants, like Sandy Berger did for Bill Clinton years ago. It's a crime to remove that info from those rooms, a prison sentence type of crime, not a slap on the wrist. Her stupidity or paranoia, justified or not, caused her to use what is probably an illegal server to store her Sec of State data. How she obtained that data, how it got emailed to her, that may be the crime for which she loses everything.",-0.968
