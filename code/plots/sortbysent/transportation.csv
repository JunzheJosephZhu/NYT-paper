0,"Money is worth more than miles. You can spend money anywhere, at any time. <br/><br/>I am not an embittered occasional flier. In fact, I have redeemed mileage in the last 5 years to go to Indonesia, Japan and Australia. And I'm still accruing mileage -- by flying.<br/><br/>But mileage credit cards are not worth it, except when they have a huge bonus, at least 30,000 miles, as an introductory enticement. I use credit cards that give me 1.5% back and I'm happy with that. Occasionally I encounter someone who tells me that they get 2 miles per dollar spent and theoretically that's worth more. Yeah, good luck spending that. ",0.9816
1,"There's lots of ways to use the need for a rush and help others at the same time: EMT, smoke jumpers, emergency medicine, fighter pilots, search and rescue (well that's not a ""rush"" but might have been better for them). <br/><br/>Those that admire these narcissists should admire those who use their talents to serve others in need at the same time. Not just ""show off"" and then require genuine rescuers to try to rescue them!",0.9761
2,"Having never lived in the US or flown on any US airlines, it's interesting to read the comments from American's in respect of the poor service the US airlines provide.<br/><br/>Compare that to the airlines I often fly, Emirates, Etihad and Air New Zealand, and these airlines consistently rank in the top 20, top 10 or lead awards each year in the world airline awards. They're consistently innovating and very rarely complaining about outside factors.<br/><br/>In the overall 'World's best airline' category, which takes into account service, timeliness, price, catering, affordability etc, an American airline isn't seen until you get to #26 - Virgin America. <br/><br/>It's off-topic, but interesting that in the face of continued allegations coming from the United, Delta et al, aimed at the Gulf Carriers, that the most important part of their business is being ignored - customers.<br/>Their approach to an increasingly competitive and global industry doesn't seem to be innovation, efficiency or customer-first, but rather scale-up, smother, lobby and hope. ",0.9683
3,"RJG--<br/><br/>That IS the issue.  Delta's de-valued the currency so much that a poor guy flying 50K miles a year on DL doesn't have a shot at a  better seat, upgrade, more legroom or getting a re-booking for weather or mechanical IRROPS situations.<br/><br/>The credit card miles (and those who exploit them) have completely corrupted what WAS a simple premise: ""Fly a lot with us and we'll reward your loyalty with better service and free leisure travel"".<br/><br/>Credit card miles (and other affinity programs) have destroyed the value of the currency. And, with load factors high and financial incentives to de-value further, those precious SkyMiles will turn into the modern day equivalent of Weimar Deutschmarks in 1923--  a million miles of flying will get you an upgrade from RDU to ATL on a Delta Connection Beech1900.",0.9603
4,"   Many commenters are sharing their justifications for using Uber over cabs, and insinuating that whatever benefits Uber has are intrinsic.  I doubt that.  Around here, I can get a real cab anytime I want one.  I can even hail it with my phone ( call or app ) if that's a huge deal.  I can schedule one to show tomorrow to take me to the airport, or wherever.  They will text me an update when they are on the way.<br/><br/>   Best of all, the cab that shows up isn't part of a criminal enterprise.<br/><br/>   Even if you think Uber's highly-questionable business model is the greatest thing since sliced bread, how can you support a company that does business the way they do?  Their treatment of journalists alone is despicable.",0.9564
5,"Yes, 20K Amtrak riders use the tunnels each day.  But there are another 90K or so NJ Transit riders that also use them on a daily basis. That is a big difference, no?<br/>Also, the number of riders would increase greatly if the proposed Gateway project were to be realized: more trains, more reliability, increased speed and greater safety.  All those add up to much-improved socio-economic benefits for all in the region (and the rest of the country, too).",0.9563
6,"I have never used Uber and I don't live in NY but, from what I have read, the public likes the convenience of Uber (nobody is forced to use the service) and a lot of the Uber drivers are ex medallion drivers who seem to feel they were being ripped off by the likes of Mr. Freidman and that they are better off working under the Uber model. The legal hassle between Citibank and Mr. Friedman seems pretty irrelevant... And what is Citi going to do with a bunch of repossessed medallions anyway that are losing value by the minute? :)",0.9517
7,"I guess It's the Wisdom, Stupid.<br/>Scott Walker could orbit the sun for 150 years and still be dumb as a rock.<br/><br/>Sully Sullenberger is a great guy who did his job. I guess in America right now that is enough to get you a news job, a mention on the front page of the NYT, and Clint Eastwood thinking Oscars. Everybody likes Sully Sullenberger and his calm head has won him the designation of Sane Male in America, so he might not want Eastwood messing up his reputation or asking why US Airways couldn't figure out how to have planes fly higher than migration paths of birds that have been doing that for oh, forever.  But, anyhoo, Possible Spoiler, maybe he will make calm, middle-aged females doing their jobs ""a thing"" too, and possibly code for Vote For Hillary since she too is a calm middle aged female navigating the geese who would jam the jet engines of America, like that. Clint can be unpredictable since he actually IS old and talks to chairs while being a global treasure. Oh, Hollywood.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Reince Prebus has been ""making house calls with leeches"" for quite a few election cycles now. ",0.9445
8,"The drought and job climate is hitting many small Western communities hard, in the Sierras and Cascades the ski-based and tourist-based economies have been particularly hard-hit in the past few years.  After 25+ years in ski towns, however, my husband and I are committed to staying in the mountains and raising our son in a small town with high social and community values.  In exchange, we forfeit higher salaries and amenities many of our peers take for granted.  On the other hand, like the bumper sticker says - ""My life is better than your vacation!""",0.923
9,"During my last trip to Brazil, I was in Búzios, walking around that tourist town on a Tuesday night. Down a trendy street was lots of noise and bright lights. I walked in its direction to find a Pentacostal church in full swing. So much shouting and carrying on. A Brazilian man next to me on the sidewalk said to me, ""They go there because of the air-conditioning."" Was he being cynical or sharp?<br/><br/>A few days later I was back in Rio, in a taxi, speeding passed what seemed to be miles of huge charter buses. I've never seen anything like it in the U.S. The taxi driver said, ""There's a Pentacostal event in town."" I was amazed. <br/><br/>I lived in Brazil when I was a child, and I know the people need something. But this is really just an extension of what they've always had: wishes and magic. I hope this is just a necessary phase in a sad history. <br/><br/>And then there is the beautiful, artistic, musical Brazil. Thank God.",0.9201
10,"Get off your high horse much?  Blatter (he from ""Europe and the West"") is the problem.  He will use anything as an excuse to reverse course come December.

13,"This is the sort of garbage that gives opponents of the fast track trade deal even more political ammunition. There have been sound arguments in support of the TPA, but when we see the rabble in corporate boardrooms pull the stunt that Disney has pulled, it's awfully hard to trust anything that big corporate interests say will benefit us.",0.8835
14,"As an infrequent flier with a status somewhere between lead and copper, I am quite pleased with the fact that there are people willing to pay $1000 for a round trip from NYC to San Diego, in return for an extra few inches of legroom and a free cocktail. Thanks to their subsidy I can make the same trip in the back of the plane for $400, which barely even covers my share of the fuel cost.",0.8805
15,"Actually, one possible positive of automated cars and/or 'smart roads' is that the cars would travel much faster.  Speed is not really the problem.   It's differentials in speed and poor driving (following too closely for example).    If all cars were automated, they could be spaced closer together and travel faster.  But yes, I'm very concerned about security and privacy issues.  ",0.8713
16,"In my basement I have a box which contains ripped (how else could they possibly be?) ticket stubs from the '70s from NY Ranger games ($12 for sixth-row seats. Remember when red seats were affordable to simple people like us, NYers?), Met games at Shea, and Jet games at Shea, too. <br/><br/>This new ticketing style has also affected concerts, and I saved my stubs from Central Park shows ($5 for the best seats, $3 for the others) and other local arenas.<br/><br/>It's just weird these days when I go to any event at MSG and they beep me in with their scanner hovering over my letter-sized computer printout. <br/><br/>Bring back real tickets!!!!!",0.8667
17,"I noticed the pride in comments like ""Mom is 94 and she still drives"".  I'm 72 and I'd like to keep on walking without being picked off by someone who didn't know when to stop driving.  <br/><br/>I realize older people have a need of mobility, but knowing that someone with reduced reaction time and impaired vision is breezing along in ""control"" of a 3,000-lb vehicle is scary.<br/><br/>There comes a time when hopping into the car is just a bad idea, and people can still pass a vision test but have limited vision.  States need to look into ways of helping people meet their transportation needs so they can hand in the keys.",0.8589
18,"I've spent a lot of time figuring out what data to collect and how to analyze it. And reflecting deeply on that process can take you to some very dark places.  When you take a step back, you realize that values are implicit in the entire process. But which values should be? At some point, you realize that the values themselves can be driven by data. And the values suggested by data take you someplace very distant from where we are, someplace much darker -  closer to God I think, and that is terrifying to understand.",0.8442

20," names such as ""economy"" which might as well say ""lower class"".<br/><br/>I think ""Steerage"" would be appropriate.  Add a few cows or goats for authenticity.  I fly once every two or three years instead of two or three times a year now.  Then again, I don't go to baseball games any more when I visit the States either. Anyone got an unused stadium suite for me and my friends?   I had a great trip last year from Los Angeles to San Jose on Amtrak, though.  How long will that last, though, with the current line-up in Congress?",0.8156
21,"We say about some people that they seem to be ""an old soul.""  Such people when we meet them may actually be quite young in years, and many of those I've met have not been particularly adept in some kinds of social skills (like those involved in poker playing or hard bargaining or finessing) -- their success with others seems to come from a deeper place than ""skills.""  I think I saw Candidate Obama as such a person.  How such people bridge the gap between their perspective and actually governing -- the pragmatics of assembling people around them to implement their policies and vision and to get on board with those action plans those beyond their team -- I don't know.  Plenty of older people have ""younger"" souls and social skills better suited for getting what they want, including assembling a team that can do that.  But what such people with younger souls and such social skills seem to want is often self-serving or worse, as they have less insight.  I guess what I am saying is that age is relevant as a factor, but it's only one of many, some of which we never talk about.  We get in each candidate a package of this and that, and we try to choose the best combination of those features in the choices we have, it seems to me.<br/><br/>As for the geese, they were in the sky before we were flying planes.  Maybe someone will file suit on their behalf, for wrongful consumption by a jet engine.",0.8047

25,"It is regretable that global warming became a political issue rather than a technical challenge.  It should have never happened.  I don't know who to blame but it was stupid, beyond belief.  <br/><br/>Republican President Isenhower, when he found himself between a rock and a hard place on putting the Intertate Highway System through an uncooperative State system, came up with the Defense Highway System which got him over the Constitutional challenge hurdle.<br/><br/>Likewise on Global Warming, President Obama should direct for National Security purposes two major Defense projects, <br/><br/>1) A Defense Interstate Maglev Transport  System which would result in the development of a 300 mph superconducting Maglev national logistics network for passengers &amp; freight trucks, see:  <a href=""http://www.magneticglide.com"" title=""www.magneticglide.com"" target=""_blank"">www.magneticglide.com</a> for concept, that would interconnect the major metro areas and ports of the country. 74% of the population would live within 15 miles of a Maglev station.<br/><br/>2) A Defense Maglev Launched, Space Based Electric Power Generating Satellite System to beam electric power to receiving stations on Earth for distribution on Grids. <br/><br/>This should be done as an International Project like the international space station so as to avoid it being used as a military weapon.

29,"I've got to say that as a customer generally of American, I was pleasantly surprised when in 2008, I was rebooked on Continental through Houston. The seat was very comfortable, service was excellent, and the crew were very pleasant. I haven't ridden on the new United, but have not found reason to stray from American, except to the Caribbean on JetBlue. When I had a singularly nightmarish trip on American the other year, they were very responsive to my complaints about problems with delays, ground staff and crew surliness. That's been my only problem with American, including flights on the new combined airline. I used to hate flying on US Airways which compared unfavorably to a crowded schoolbus. I had recent experience flying on a former US Airways flight round trip and was surprised by the improvements. I would guess that the experience is dependent on the success at merging different cultures.",0.6987

I wouldn't rate an Uber driver lower if s/he told me they weren't enthusiastic about driving, and I don't see why anyone else would either. I don't think the Uber drivers I've talked to are all lying to me; they seem genuinely positive about the opportunity Uber gives them, often going into a fair amount of detail about how the flexibility works for them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've had a few cab drivers over the years launch into tirades about all kinds of stuff, including their unhappy lives.<br/><br/>That's my experience.

At the Lex and 53 Station I was coming down the long escalator when a homeless guy was at the end feeding about a dozen of them, and me trying to run up the down staircase so I wouldn't have to pass them. I just can't forget that in the late 80's I used to meet a friend at the corner of library to ride the train home together, always saw a few playing in the dirt on the 42 and 5th corner everyday.

The elephant involved is Eleanor, orphaned as a calf and raised to return to the wild by Daphne Sheldrick in Tsavo National Park in Kenya.<br/><br/>""Just inside the park is Simon Trevor's house. Until a few years ago, Eleanor would visit Simon regularly, insisting on turning on the taps, but forgetting to turn them off again! She would amble up to Simon and drink. One day, there were about ten people standing on his verandah. On this particular occasion, as she approached from fifty yards or so away, she visibly quickened her pace, and with her trunk out in the scenting mode, she hurried to the awaiting group. Without hesitation she went straight up to one lady standing with her hands behind her back, and probed her wrist, withdrawing her trunk a few seconds later.

I know this is nitpicking but I for one am glad that people aren't allowed to pick wild flowers. These flowers are delicate and rarely last once they are picked, so what is the point. Why can't people enjoy the sublime beauty the flowers add to the surroundings, which would explain why such a policy is in place. As for mountain bikers, I'm sure many would have the same mentality that many NYC bikers have on the city streets, that somehow they own the streets or in trails and everyone else should accommodate them.

Meanwhile, ""unbundling"" every possible element of air travel and charging fees for them lets them give customers the low fares they demand while giving extra special service to shareholders. <br/><br/>Airlines can get away with those games because they know that nearly all the self-loading cargo that occupies the constantly-shrinking seats has no other choice.

That's the Toddlin' Town for you.""<br/><br/>MSY in New Orleans, from Wikipedia: ""The airport was originally named after daredevil aviator John Moisant, who died in 1910 in an airplane crash on agricultural land where the airport is now located. Its IATA code MSY was derived from Moisant Stock Yards, as Lakefront Airport retained the ""NEW"" code.""",-0.9538
154,"I'm so sick of people acting like victims when they break the laws.  At our grandsons's graduation we had the same fools spread out all over the auditorium with those air horns.  Every time a name was called, they screamed at the top of their lungs and blew those obnoxious horns.  Seriously people, what is wrong with you that you have no consideration for anyone but your self?  How anyone can be that rude, disrespectful, obnoxious and selfish is beyond me.  This behavior ruins it for everyone else.  If you want to blow horns and act stupid, rent a private space for a graduation party and have at it.  It's the same in movie theaters...and you all know who you are.  ",-0.978
155,"Mr. Blow sys that traffic law enforcement is merely a means of raising revenue and is thus unfair to poor people. While there are a very few pockets where that might be the case, the fact is that truly poor people, and black Americans are vastly over-represented among them, don't drive cars. Traffic law enforcement is all that stands between poor people on foot and bicycles and a bloody death at the hands of scofflaw motorists. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there has been woefully little traffic law enforcement, largely because the overwhelming majority of Americans enjoy breaking the law while driving. The result is that we have the bloodiest roads in the western world. Over two million Americans are needlessly maimed and over thirty thousand killed annually by our lack of traffic law enforcement. I suspect the number of black Americans killed and maimed by cops during traffic stops is substantially fewer.",-0.9828
