0,"It's quite possible the law of value in the fine dining restaurant business is unworkable. In other words, the price a restauranteur is required to sell his product to make a profit is not of good or fair value based on what the product offers the buyer. This explains why Mr. Arifai was getting from his customers, on average, ""less than half"" of what he would have priced his entrees. After all, it's only a piece of skate. There is only so much you can do to it to make a $12 value worth $25. (Foam?) The difference is sometimes called ambience. But how can that be achieved with the barbaric noise level you find in 90% of all restaurants. Can you really enjoy your loved one or friends in that environment? A couple easily pays over a hundred dollars for a mediocre meal nearly every time they go out. It's the worst deal in town. Instead, invite some friends over for whatever. Enjoy their company for real. And buy a good pair of shoes with the money you didn't waste on an illusion.",0.9827
1,"The word tapa means ""cover"" and it originally described the small piece of cheese or ham one used to cover a glass of ""oloroso"" wine so it would not loose its aroma. Like other commenter wrote, it is supposed to be small and humble, something you eat so your alcohol does not go down in an empty stomach. For the longest time they were free with your drink in Spain, and it is still free in some places in the South, like Granada. Of course people don't want to pay a lot for tortilla, after all it *is* only potatoes, eggs and onions (although terribly delicious). If you make a very special tortilla, with very expensive ingredients, well, I am sure it is good but not quite what was meant to be. Tapas are not what they have become outside Spain: a culinary and expensive delight. They have have always been part of a social fabric, with friends hoping form bar to bar trying the different tapas (while drinking wine and beer); usually simple, cheap and delicious.",0.982
2,"I have three boys whose eating habits are remarked upon by almost everyone they eat with, from family to teachers to friends' parents and to their pediatricians.  If I am to believe these people, my children are freakishly excellent eaters - eating a wide variety of healthy, nutritious food, trying new things, eating treats in moderation.  How is it that I managed to be so lucky to have three great eaters?  Perhaps it really is just dumb luck, but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the way my husband and I eat - a wide variety of healthy, nutritious food - and how that's the model our kids have grown with, from pregnancy through teenagehood.  We cook, we grocery shop, we plan meals, we talk about food, we eat - as a family.  We don't have lousy food in the house, because we don't eat it.  My kids marveled at boxed mac and cheese, and had become proficient at making a quick tomato sauce or pesto before they had ever tried jarred sauce.  For all of the parents lamenting their children's demands of only junk - well, who bought it in the first place?  Processed foods are designed to be the most intensely rewarding, hitting all the salt/fat/sugar high notes, so to speak.  How do you expect the taste buds and brains of kids raised on GoGurt, Frosted Flakes, soda and Fruit Roll-Ups to react to plain Greek yogurt, muesli, water or a perfectly ripe peach?",0.9803
3,"I like good food, but I also don't want to spend a bunch of money and still feel hungry.  Fine dining sometimes makes me feel like I'm on a diet.  When I go out to eat, it is a splurge, not just in dollars, but calories too. I like a fixed price menu.  Here is the cost of a full meal without wine, here is the cost with two glasses of chief chosen wine. At my income bracket, I don't want to be cheap, but I can't afford to be chump either. I want you to stay in business too. Clearly a delicate balance.  I wish you success!",0.9724
4,"You jest! One of the best pairings I've ever done was a bottle of Tott's American Champagne (I shutter to not include the """"s) and a plate of salty salamis, olives, pickled mushrooms and cheese. The bottle was a very generous gift given to us with the deepest kindness imaginable from a new Russian immigrant family. Yes, I am a snob, but I smiled appreciatively, opened it and served it. Wine protocol totally thrown out the window. And you know what? It worked - the cloying sweetness against the salt and vinegar. A decent Riesling would have been destroyed. As for Boone's Farm, harkening back to my college youth (I never drank the stuff, but my roommates did), I would recommend serving it with hash-brownies ala Alice B Toklas, and a fine marijuana joint. Short of that, grow up.",0.9706
5,"Guideline for When Food Goes Bad<br/><br/>People throw out food everyday because of the expiration date on the side of the labeling, but what if that food was not really expired. Most companies put a best by date on the food that they sell but food like that could go days more without going bad. That date is for the sake of the company to tell the consumer to try and eat the product by that date. This unwillingly allows the company to trick people into thinking that the food is bad. The company then makes money because the consumer then goes to by the product again. People should check the food for signs of expiration. The only food that requires an expiration date is baby formula So the next time you go to throw out the bread, check for the signs because that could create many sandwiches instead of trash.",0.9688

Frying eggplant makes it really delicious, especially with some garlic and olive oil on top. But the question is, is it healthy to fry it or not? From reading many articles, i understood that eggplants absorb oil so basically grilling them might be way healthier than frying. people's opinions on frying might be a little bit inaccurate, as the idea of frying is not always unhealthy it just all depends on what oil do you use. vegetable oils are usually healthier than others, especially olive oil, so this is absolutely healthier than any other. I liked about the article that this is a very useful thing to know how to be aware of what you eat.   ",0.9672
7,"The students get contradictory messages about food while they are in public school.  They are told ""Eat Healthy"" but candy and fast food incentives for good behavior and/or achievement abound.  School cafeterias have their own food culture: The staff may push extra helpings of the least nutritious foods on offer, so as to avoid ""waste""; children who have a healthy packed lunch may be given the unused ""tater tots"" or rib sandwiches on the lunch menu, without their parents' knowledge, much less permission.  (Guess where most of that healthy packed food ends up at the end of lunch period?)<br/><br/>The reality is that most public school children are taught in a food culture that provides little consistency or support for making healthy choices.  And let's not forget the impact of their visual experiences while in class, walking the halls and climbing on the yellow bus: A majority of the adults who have authority over them are obese!",0.9652
8,As soon as I tried this recipe and saw it cooking I knew it was going to be a good one. The smells from the oven alone were spectacular and when the pork was done the meat was perfect and the cracklings were unbelievable. The leftovers were great on sandwiches with some slaw and we even made nachos with some of the leftovers as well. Great recipe.,0.9628
9,"I had mildly high hopes for this Zucchini Flan. I say ""mildly"" because I am not a huge fan of the zucchini as it tends to be way too watery and tasteless in most recipes I have made with it. Baring frying it up in a hot skillet (my favorite way) BUT I love David Tanis and his recipes and was intrigued by his instruction to ""blanch the zucchini in salty water then drain excess water on a plate to cool afterwards"" to see if that solved the probelm. Not to mention the picture of the fished recipe looked delicious and my farmer husband had just brought home some zucchini from our farm. Well, I followed his directions entirely and let it rest until room temperature before serving... BUT lo and behold the freaking zucchini made this a watery soupy tasteless mess.<br/>SO disappointed.<br/> <a href=""http://www.nocisonoma.com/saltyspicybitterandsweet/"" title=""http://www.nocisonoma.com/saltyspicybitterandsweet/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nocisonoma.com/saltyspicybitterandsweet/</a>",0.9541
10,"I made a reservation some two months in advance to hold my law firm's holiday luncheon party last December at my favorite up scale restaurant in Del Mar California. Fifteen of us were to attend. Our firm has had several holiday luncheons there in the past,and I'm a well know ""regular"" at the restaurant,having dined there countless times over the past twenty years. Nevertheless,two days before the luncheon,I got a call from the restaurant canceling the reservation because a ""larger party"" wanted the space! The next time I ate there which was much later,I reminded my waiter of what had happened,and I was given a complimentary dessert. ",0.9523

13,"I second the endorsement of Atlantis -- it is also the most consistently good wine from Santorini that I have tried, and the price is fantastic (here in Baltimore/DC area I have bought it for $12).

14,"I do not see the problem.  Japan has always protected rice and everyone should respect that.  Rice is their lifeblood and with a limited amount of land they cannot afford to have any riceland lost to foreign competition.

19,"""Small Plates""<br/>Most little kids are known for being blunt and straightforward, simply because they do not know any better. So, when The New York Times treated six second graders to a seven-course tasting menu at Daniel -- where the price is around $220 per person --  I expected nothing less of their honesty. The video starts off with the six adorable kids strolling down the street in front of the restaurant Daniel in New York City. While the boys have no problems getting in the revolving door, the girls giggle that the boys were supposed to wait for them as they are left behind. Once they are all inside, the waiter leads the youngsters to a table set for 6 people. Then chef Daniel Boulud then comes out and introduces the school kids to his restaurant. As each of the seven plates are brought out to the children, they all have different reactions. One second-grader, Amira, compares her squash ravioli to ‘soap’, and another, Rohan, says his caviar looks like ‘a little forest’. These little statements garnered a laugh from me. Towards the end, chef Boulud and his waiters bring each of the kids a chef’s hat with different symbols on each front and the course they’d all been waiting for, dessert. Plentiful giggles fill the atmosphere in the restaurant as the kids dig into their Fraises et Coquelicots and Velours D’Abricots. The video ends with second grader Maya initiating a toast. As kids all clink their glasses together and smile I realize how cute children can be.",0.9296
20,"I read ""A Walk in the Woods"" before I ventured out to spend 3 days and 30 miles on the A-Trail with my son who was attempting the whole thing. The book didn't dissuade me from the outing; however, once I started, got rained on for half the time and ate dehydrated awfulness out of a pouch, I was ready for a hot shower and a good meal. Somehow, my son managed to survive the whole 2200 mile journey from Georgia to Maine! Anyone who accomplishes this feat is my hero. And yes, he did see a few bears along the way.",0.9286

I bought an orange as a backup, but we don't start school until after Labor Day, so my quest continues....  Honestly I feel very fortunate that the expense for all the supplies is something my family can easily afford and all I really have to complain about is the headache of tracking everything down. And I understand that there are families who wont' be able to afford supplies for their own kids, so I'm totally fine with adding to the communal property of pencils and markers and glue sticks, etc. It's just such a PROCESS every August to try to get it all roped down.

25,"If you have your own garden, it is really easy to blanch and freeze your own corn. There are tools that make stripping off the kernels really easy, with even the option to ""milk"" the kernels as you strip, so you can make creamed corn in the middle of the winter.

Westerner's consume the highest percentage of Processed food on the planet.  We just don't eat right, and we're setup for failure before we even hit the age of 18.  We consume high calorie, sugary cereals for breakfast - we're given things like fruit snacks, fruit roll ups, chocolate covered granola bars (all calorie laden) in our lunches for school.  There's vending machines in schools - fries are served as sides over salads, and fresh fruit options cost a ton of money (versus, say a muffin).<br/><br/>Cereal can have 200 - 400 calories per cup.

29,This recipe works! It's very tasty and I don't feel guilty eating it. I grate the corn over a cookie sheet and saute a hot green pepper with the onion. This time of year we have so much fresh corn and this is a great way to serve it as an accompaniment to a nice dinner.,0.9022
30,"Serious Eats was a seriously wonderful food site with excellent restaurant reviews by Mr' Levine and Mr. Falkenberg, reviews of neighborhoods with tons of food porn, well researched ""the best of"" articles on topics like Chinese wonton soup, pork buns, pumpkin pie and the like.

The website was just about food in the five boroughs and it was exceedingly well done.<br/>All of that fell apart about a year ago when Serious Eats announced a ""change"".

Examples include roasted brussels sprouts with a little olive oil spray and balsamic vinegar, or steamed string beans sprinkled with a little Whole Foods Sesame Seed - Ginger spice blend. (Salads are not included because I don’t like them and they are too much work.) Most dinners for our family are now composed of some type of meat or fish and one of these vegetable recipes. Potatoes or pasta are once a week only. (My spouse has also lost 20 lbs.)   In addition - there are low carb wraps, such as Tumaro's, that have been a godsend in making low carb lunches.

The only thing important to know about herbs in relation to food is how a particular herb, or a combination of herbs tastes TO YOU as the chef, or more likely, as the cook. The rest of it is optional.<br/><br/>Also, herbs always work with spices, which are also mostly plant-based, except for the most important spice of any of them: salt, which actually does help keep us alive, every minute of every day. If food doesn't have enough salt on it, it usually tastes bland. Some cooks know how to use citrus products to compensate for this, but, unless the food in question is naturally high in sodium (few are), it will need some salt, or you will be using larger quantities of herbs, and still not be getting the desired effects.<br/><br/>Herbs and spices are a Godsend because most food is so dull on its own.

206,"Thank you DBL for your well written comment!  I completely agree with you that kids are in fact everywhere these days, and that is not a positive.  My husband and I had our 10 year anniversary dinner ruined at a very fancy and upscale restaurant when school aged children began playing with water glasses, using their forks to bang on glasses to make loud noises.  The wait staff, although probably not pleased, played along with this ""game"".   This went on for 40 minutes or so. Although the kids were not babies, they were certainly out of place and I am assuming bored to tears.  When you are paying over $100 for a meal in a fancy restaurant on a Saturday, at 9pm in the evening, you should not expect it to resemble a daycare.  To add insult to injury, we were also paying our babysitter to look after our school aged child, who certainly did not belong in that fancy environment.  <br/><br/>This is another reason I actively parent my son, and ensure he behaves in public and especially age appropriate restaurants; who knows how many adults there are also paying their hard earned money to a babysitter, so they can have a child free dinner themselves?  <br/><br/>If the restaurant has a wine list, linen table cloth, and no children's menu, children do not belong.

The FDA may not agree, but I've found that starting with meat that's room temp results in less risk of over cooking.<br/><br/>2.  Season both sides with salt, pepper and olive oil and sear in a screaming hot skillet for 2 - 3 minutes per side.<br/><br/>3.  If necessary (based on size of steak and preference of the person who will be eating) transfer to a prewarmed oven to finish roasting.  I will typically let a steak rest covered on the counter for 10 minutes before serving.<br/><br/>Works for us.  I buy beef from my butcher or, if I have a chance to get to the farmers market, directly from the rancher.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is that to meet local ""health"" requirements, the beef I buy from the rancher is frozen after being cut, so I have to allow time to defrost before cooking.

Lard has a substantial amount of monounsaturated fat, which is good. And saturated fats aren't as big a demon as we were told. So I figured I'd buy some lard. Looked at the label: it had trans fats! No doubt to allow it to not need refrigeration, like Crisco. I concluded that the powers that provide our food had made lard unusable too. There probably were, and today certainly are, sources of unadulterated lard, and I just didn't work hard enough at finding them. Anyway, it might also be noted that many of our vegetable oils -- especially the most highly unsaturated ones (like sesame, and even more common ones) -- ought to be refrigerated also.",-0.6131

235,"If a restaurant wants to add 20% service charge instead of a tip really doesn't make a difference to my bottom line. I leave 20% pretty much all the time anyway, whether it be in the form of a tip or a surcharge (unless the service is particularly bad, then maybe I'll leave less). I've waited enough tables for crappy tips long enough to know that I don't want to be that guy. It's hard work, and there're plenty of customers who will go out of their way to find an excuse to leave a small tip - or no tip at all. But my concern is how much of that surcharge is taken by the owners to pay for the increased minimum wage? Instead of raising prices - which is what should be done when costs increase - they are essentially taking what used to be tips and making it into part of the salary. I understand the reluctance to raise prices. It's a highly-competitive business, and many restaurants in this city fail in the first year because it's extremely competitive and difficult.<br/>The issue is that there are too many restaurants in this city to begin with.
