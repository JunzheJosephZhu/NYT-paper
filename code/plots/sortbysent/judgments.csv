0,"Wow, such a wise kid! I'm impressed. I have to say though, he is still not whole, but he is mature enough to understand that that's just the way he is, and that it's better than what we can do for him at this time. There's a difference, and it's an important one because it makes him look smarter, stronger and more mature. Insisting that he's whole and that there's no problem at all is just being an unrealistic, stubborn ostrich, and that's true for any disability. Recognizing the disability as such but being able to pull together a full life despite it is what's actually impressive and inspiring to me, and shows true strength.",0.9896
1,"<a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/choosing-the-right-running-shoes/?src=me"" title=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/choosing-the-right-running-shoes/?src=me"" target=""_blank"">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/choosing-the-right-running-shoe...</a> <br/><br/>This article about choosing the right running shoes interested me because I'm looking to get new shoes at the moment. I thought it might give me some kind of sciency technical advice, but instead, what the article said was very simple- if it's comfortable, it's the right one! It's really just common sense (but now scientifically proven).<br/>This got me started thinking. The article suggested that your feet and senses are actually the best judge of what's best for it. Could it be that the same rule applies in other areas as well? Eg. what position we sleep in, our posture etc.<br/>If so, it would be rather ironic, as we spend years and years studying the right way to do things while nature has been telling it to us all along.<br/>Of course, I'm sure that not all of what our senses say is good is the right thing for us. Chips taste great! But that doesn't mean we should eat it all the time...",0.9886
2,"I think the ""good"", ""better"" and ""best"" ratings system is a mistake. It implies that WF thinks the pile of conventionally-grown asparagus really is ""best"", but what does that mean? Best for your health? Best for your budget? Best for the environment? The terms used undermine WF's previous efforts to convince us that organic food, pricey as it is, is best for our health and our environment. <br/><br/>On the bright side, I am glad to see WF is finally having to think deeply about competition. I stopped shopping there a long time ago, as I simply could not afford the prices there. ",0.9864
3,"There is growing literature that supports the view of an  intrinsic motivation to help, share and cooperate with others, and that thesa motivations are depply satifying and meaningful.  But these motivations , ""the better angeles of our nature"" can only flourish were ther is a sense of safety and trust, and were fear is not used to impose compliance. When we feel endangered we revert to a every man for themselves psycology.  Creating these conditions is what good and enlightened leadership is all about",0.9796

Thank god, they aren't.""<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------<br/><br/>From Friedrich Nietzsche:<br/><br/>""In old Italian cities, even among the lower classes, there is an aristocratic self-sufficiency and manly breeding (which showed that it was not necessary, as Germans sometimes said, to have a great state to make the soul free and manly);  a poor Venetian gondolier is ever a better figure than a Berlin Geheimrath, and in the end, indeed, a better man.""",0.91

11,We also should not make the assumption that folks over 60 cannot have new ideas.  The division which says that younger folks always have the fresh perspective is a false one. Sometimes someone who has been at it for a while has seen what works and what does not and has far more specific ideas about what needs to change and how. <br/><br/>We should measure the newness or forward-looking value of the ideas coming from Mr. Cruz et al against past GOP-speak.

People use it more to suit themselves as an individual then for the good of the organization.  The Koch's only want it to fatten their pockets.  Their pockets and no one else's.

Even generationally-delayed gratification?  Or will we seek out government intervention to try to ensure equality of outcome, and remove personal responsibility from the mix?  It is unfortunate, but in some ways we need the example of bad decisions to teach the rest if us the value of good decisions.
