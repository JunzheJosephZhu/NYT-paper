0,"I'm a long-time deadhead and proud to identify myself as such.<br/>Last night's show was absolutely amazing!<br/>I was fortunate to attend the Santa Clara shows and thought they were wonderful as well; the (naturally occurring) rainbow on Saturday was truly magical.<br/>Those who don't get it, never will. We deadheads are perhaps some of the most fortunate people in the history of time! We have experienced true magic, and our community is so lucky to have the opportunity to come together and create that magic again.<br/>We carry it into our lives and into the future.<br/>I am grateful that the core four decided to play these shows. I am grateful to them forever for the joy they have brought to so many.<br/>I met my husband at a show, and nearly all my friends. Twenty years after Jerry's passing, our bond has not diminished. I chose my profession in part because it afforded me a flexible schedule so that I could easily attend 25-30 shows a year. It's been a great career, and I enjoy it so much that I will choose to continue working past retirement age.<br/>Through shared love of the music I've been privileged to meet an amazing number of brilliant, creative and accomplished people I would never otherwise have met.

1,"I adore this lady. Yes she is beautiful, but apart from her beauty and model looks (which everyone here seems to be focussing on) I think she is a lady who represents women with her strength and true individuality.  Ana is quickly becoming one of the cultural icons of our time, creating something new fresh and wonderful.  Her work is simplistic enough that it hasn't become cynical or saturated with political or social messages.  I love the colour and originality, I love her childish play in design and she is someone that deserves all the praise she receives! I wish people would hold back on sharing negativity when someone beautiful is doing something wonderful.",0.9965
2,"Dear Dr. Sacks,<br/><br/>Your love for science, audacious pursuit of your passions, courage and hope in face of death, as well as exquisite expressions of your knowledge, thoughts, and experiences of a unique life have endlessly inspired me.  I aspire to be a doctor specializing in the brain and the mind, to bring new insights into our world just as you did to enrich our lives. Death is an unknown that one can only experience but not share, but when it reveals to one in its full exposure, it will be a revelation for one who rejoices in the discovery of truth. Thank you for sharing with us your wonderful journey through life. I wish you love, joy, and peace!   ",0.9932
3,"John's experience of self-expression and comfort from you was incredibly important to him, you may be sure.  In the life of a child who is abused or neglected (or I guess in any child's life but especially these), even a tiny instance of comfort, hope, or love has more power of healing than we adults might suppose.  A single expression of praise, a brief time of acceptance and care, can become a touchstone for a suffering child, a memory and hope at once, cherished and remembered, clung to through even rough days and nights.  A little love goes a long way.  It's always worth giving. ",0.9923
4,"Let me tell my little story: To practice my reading only Italian, once in a while I go to Il Corriere de la Sera, the Italian newspaper. One day I saw an European dating website, Nirvam and out of curiosity about Italian and European women, I started checking its female pictures. Suddenly I saw a woman that I found very attractive, but she wasn't European, she was Peruvian!<br/>Out of curiosity also I wrote to her thanks to three days of free use of the website. She answered me and we started corresponding. She was in Lima, Peru and I was in Houston. Almost from the beginning we used Skype to make sure we were whom we said we were. After a while, she visited me in Houston and we had a great time together. She started to come back to Houston every three months during six years. In 2013 I went to Lima and we went together to Buenos Aires and Igua√ßu Falls in Argentina. We spent three months together. Now, keep in mind that a non-stop flight from Lima to Houston takes six and one half hours and costs more than a thousand dollars. United Airlines was delighted with our romance! To make the story short, we married on April 7th. of this year. During all this time, we found out that we had many things in common, like classical music, opera and ballet (Her daughter is a ballet dancer and choreographer), politics, etc., etc. We spend many hours drinking tea and talking at the kitchen table. She told me that she was in Nirvan looking to practice her Italian, not looking for boyfriend...",0.9898
5,"I intend no disrespect to the author of this story, who showed only the best intentions. But I have to wonder where the value is in a piece on the final Grateful Dead shows by someone trying to piece it all together at the last minute. The author did some research, followed the shows on social media, noticed some cliches. Finally we learn that ""extend guitar solos"" didn't move him, but the crowd's energy did. This just reads as superficial click-bait for dead fans. Anyone with even moderate appreciation for the band's history knows that there is a tremendous amount of musical interplay going on with these players, not merely extended guitar solos. And really, we have to read the words ""tie-dyed clothes"" in a piece about this band....again? Is this the most interesting thing we can say about these passionate music fans? What about their role in allowing the world's biggest DIY rock band to flourish outside of the music industry, or the nomadic grey economy they fostered for 30+ years? I appreciate the attention given to these concerts by the mainstream media. But we are long used to those who don't understand it. This is merely another bit of text devoted to earnest head scratching. I think a lot of deadheads would agree that pieces like these add very little to the discussion about a vibrant piece of American music history. ",0.9887
6,"One story I especially really like because I am an amateur musician.<br/><br/>There is the story that Oliver Sacks relates about the musician with perfect pitch has to play a concert but the piano was tuned a half step out of tune.  The fellow heard everything he played in perfect pitch in his head at the same time he heard the piano playing out of tune.<br/><br/>Somehow that has always tickled me in a way, and I have related to story many times to friends that I Jam with.  As a musician, one can really appreciate humor in such a dilemma.<br/><br/>Thank you, Dr. Sacks for this and the many other fascinating stories you shared with us.",0.9877
7,"I saw the exhilarating, heart breaking 'Fun Home' last month and am delighted at its award for best musical. Little Sydney Lukas almost stole the show, what a talent.  When she sang Ring of Keys there were few dry eyes.  We were also fortunate to get tickets to 'Something Rotten' and 'On the Town', fabulous shows!  But 'Fun Home' was something special, and I agree with Michael Cerveris in his hope the Supreme Court is listening. ",0.9863

9,"Dear Oliver,<br/>Thank you for your wisdom, humility and honesty.<br/>As a 20-something Englishman living in New York in the early 90's, I remember you coming to visit my Dad - your old weightlifting friend, Ben Helfgott - at my apartment in Lincoln Centre. Your passion for life was infectious, and you swam vigorously and with almost childish delight in brand new appt block's magnificent pool. A few weeks later, we travelled to England together, and i spent much of the night, standing in the galley, talking with you as you didn't enjoy having to sit down!<br/>Dad often remarked upon  how many of his friends found more meaning in their Jewish roots at the very end of their lives.<br/>Your NYT articles, have been so meaningful to me and so many others. I'm excited to  leave tomorrow for holiday with On The Move packed in my suitcase.<br/>Thank you for your generosity and life's gifts, Oliver.",0.9838
10,"I think that Scarlet Begonias was the peak of the show. True glorious 2nd-set intensity. Absolutely amazing. And the FOTM that followed was also pretty good. I've re-listened to Scarlet a few times already. Powerful and sweet. I couldn't believe it. I'm greatly looking forward to tonight's last show! Thank you, guys. It's been great.",0.9832
11,"Jimbo, my oldest son called me last night and we had a long conversation about... (&lt;- there they are) <br/><br/>...The Stones. It's not that he'd never heard them before but he'd somehow suddenly discovered just how good they were. He mentioned a few songs that he'd downloaded and asked for some more suggestions, which I happily supplied. <br/><br/>Then he asked what some of my other favorite bands of that era (more or less) were and I gave him a few and told him I'd send him some others when my memory got around to it. Mine were a little heavy on soul and Motown, though not exclusively so.  <br/><br/>So anyway, let's say 50's to 70's  - what are your favorite bands from that time period? I'm kind of curious to hear your thoughts on that anyway, but I'll also pass some of your recommendations along. Happy to see opinions from anyone else as well. ",0.9824

13,"Thank you, Tao of Jane, for sharing useful insights that you gained through coping, and coming to terms, with the serious issue under discussion.  Sometimes online (and offline) discussions take on a quality of music, where a somewhat ""off"" note elicits entirely undeserved judgment and censure.  It's a fine way to discourage sensitive, well-meaning people from daring to offer the non-conforming thought or observation.  I am reminded of the old saying that when we point at another, we have three fingers pointing back at ourselves.      <br/><br/>I too mourn, daily, the loss of family and nearly all my dearest friends.  I deal with it by thanking each for the kind companionship he/she gave to me while here in the flesh.  I send them love and take comfort that this love does not die.  And sometimes I pray for all who mourn and are also lonely in their mourning.  As you so wisely noted, this may indeed be the human condition.",0.9813

27,"Saw this last night and we loved it--great acting, moved quickly, a walk down memory lane and the music is still tops.  I was a sophomore in a mostly white, affluent Midwest suburb when NWA hit the scene and it became the soundtrack of my high school days.  That strange zeitgeist, the cultural and historical significance of NWA and hardcore rap was captured in this movie.  To think almost thirty years ago this music was thought to be ""nothing"", a blip.  And it changed music forever.  Unfortunately it hasn't changed the state of racial justice in our country, but that's a conversation for another day.<br/><br/>There are some really great performances from a very well-cast cast.  All of them were quite good.  I highly recommend it!",0.9683
28,"The happiest man I ever met was my father who once wrote when I was 13, 'Money is the Root of all Evil', underlined boldly three times.  He was writing to tell me that he had developed a passion to write about archeology and not to expect him to foot my school bills. Although as my father, he asked fervently that it was imperative that I understand that he loved me very much.<br/><br/>Money can give us the freedom to pursue whatever it takes to make one feel happy, but like any other tool, it helps if we know how to use it before it becomes our master.  There is nothing more rewarding to watch a man of means struggle to flourish economic growth and financial health which impacts on people in need.<br/><br/>I was fortunate in knowing of such a person in an office.  He rarely bought anything for himself, he met the epitome of a Family Man, and when my father died suddenly, while I was in a state of numbest, he placed me on a plane and sent me overseas to be with my family during this time of loss, where tears were shed and laughter shared.  It was to bring the living closer together, and in a way, it was to bring us happiness later on in life, while remembering our father with love. ",0.9679

30,"Trump is a special category of the poor that Jesus instructed us to care for and about. His poverty is the thirst one feels when they have drank all that they may, and the still feel unsatisfied. He is one who can fill his senses without filling his heart. He is the warrior who learned how to kill but lost the compassion for those who still live. And there is no method to his madness for he swirls in a cloud of confusion that grasps at anything to assuage his hunger for conquest, without realizing it is his heart that longs to be fed, with a daily bread he thinks will never be given to him. But we can help him by helping ourselves to the obvious truth he has demonstrated in the clearest of ways. Let it be understood that there is no necessary connection between a successful business person, and a leader who can serve selflessly as one who will govern for all. That is to say, let us not assume that a business person will make an effective political leader, and that the default position in considering a business leader, is one of skepticism, not automatic kneeling at the shrine of their success. A person like Trump who can live in a bubble and have things be just as he so pleases, is not someone we should trust with government, which has far greater power to make legal or illegal even the holy grail of business. Let us even be grateful for Trump, who can be a light if we so chose, in the darkness that business has long cast upon our country. Perhaps even Donald will learn.",0.9665

We have tried to get them to be their wonderful selves on a video.  They do nothing.  I mean NOTHING.  A non cat person would be amazed at how long a cat can do nothing (answer:  indefinitely or until you put the camera away.)<br/><br/>They have lovely eyes, shimmering with color.  When the camera is pointed at them the eyes shut, or the cat looks the other direction, or he runs away altogether, which at least is SOMETHING (why didn't he do that on the video?)<br/><br/>I do think they've taken possession of my soul as well as all our other stuff:)",0.9639

34,"[I'm submitting this comment again, this time without a link. Perhaps that is why it did not go through yesterday?]<br/>Ah, a lovely essay that brings it all back. I, too, went through infertility treatment for several years and finally gave birth to a beautiful daughter named...Lillie! She also had very high bilirubin and had to go under those lights. The nurses and hospital pediatrician dryly informed me and gave me some printouts to read about bilirubin. Then my ob/gyn came in and talked me down from the heights of anxiety. I recall him saying something like, ""If there was anything that had to happen to her, this is what I'd choose! She will be fine!"" She went under those lights with some sort of webbing over her eyes to protect them. We thought she looked like a little roasted chicken in one of those glass cases. It was very upsetting, especially since I was forced to leave the hospital before she could be released (insurance rules). We traveled back and forth so I could nurse her twice a day and called every morning to find out her bilirubin level and whether she could go home. The day they said ""yes"" happened to be December 24 (she was born on December 16), and when we went to pick her up, as I nervously dressed her in a velvety white onesie we'd gotten as a gift, and then nursed her before leaving for home, there was a radio playing ""Silent Night"" in the hospital nursery. Unreal. She is now 23 and still the light of our lives. Congratulations and enjoy. It goes by fast.",0.9573

37,"I repeat something I have mentioned many times in this blog:  My favorite Econ professor in the mid-60's made what to me was a profound statement that is all the more relevant today - ""you pay your taxes one way or the other"".  He taught labor economics and made other statements, one that I recall also - ""the labor movement has only one imaginative leader and that is Cesar Chavez"".  This was at a conservative, deep south, university so, in  hindsight, it was all the more remarkable.  The distribution of the tax burden in the US is criminal.  Republicans have been successful at distorting this fact by railing against taxes of any form.  In order to get more balance in place we need more Chavez's instead of the current labor leaders who look and act like thugs.  There is a severe imbalance in our American view of ourselves and the rest of the world.  I love the US and am very grateful I was born here.  Now I wonder though if ! or Clinton can bring any program or solutions that will attract both liberals and conservatives to the table.

So confronted, the candidate must either bark with the pack or be lost... All the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre ‚Äî the man who can most adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum.

58,"I lived almost this exact scenario. Five friends gathered around the home bedside of my partner - his body so drastically ravaged by cancer that he was perfectly clear on his readiness. Like this writer, I phoned the doctor when the massive morphine dose we crushed into applesauce produced only euphoria. ‚ÄúUse all the pain patches, too,‚Äù said the doctor. We did that -- sticking them all to my partner‚Äôs chest and back while mingling tears and dark humor. The best party you never wanted to attend, indeed.<br/><br/>At some point he slipped into the appearance of deep sleep. The five of us took a walk, thinking that perhaps our hovering presence kept him fettered to life. When we came back an hour later, however, he was still breathing.<br/><br/>We all stayed in the room with him after that. Finally ending up seated around his bed, with every person resting one hand on his bare chest. His breathing was slower and slower. We worried that our amateur efforts would fail and he would have a terrible awakening. With that in mind, a few of us may have actually pressed on his chest, to tell his body to stop, but we didn‚Äôt speak of that. We sang. We cried. We kissed him. We kept saying it was OK to leave. Finally one breath was clearly his last, and the five of us locked eyes -- our hands still on his chest. I will never forget that moment. <br/><br/>I also don't understand the writer's decision to depart at the end, but I don't condemn it. You're out in the blue at these times.",0.9197

As the gods intended, we are here to become more and more ourselves."" <br/><br/>Living a exemplary life or principled life or ideal life is not living an authentic life as oneself.

Maybe I'm too old and just prefer different types of music. <br/><br/>Playing off of some of the other comments, it makes one wonder how a classical composer from a different era would have combined world-class talent and years of training and experience with the modern technology, and how that would have turned out!

But I do wonder how much this has to do with her ethnicity as much as her talent. Reviews that I have read have been mostly mixed, and although it seems she is an exceptional dancer, it doesn't seem that she is truly great, like the dancer she is replacing. the fact that she did not perform all of the fouett√© turns that are fundamental to the role of Odette/Odile seems to be a particularly egregious technical omission. Is it because she simply can't perform them? Shouldn't the principal dancer of ABT (no less so, a soloist) be able to perform the movement? Or maybe she was injured, a very real possibility. As for the dearth of soloists/primas and just plain ballet dancers in general, I seriously doubt that an ballet company in America and especially in NYC would not promote dancers of color because they are of color. Because development can come late to a dancer in the inner city, or in any area that is somewhat impoverished, they may not develop the technical skills necessary to be ballerinas. As apposed to an affluent area where ballet for girls at a young age is de riguer. The possibility of developing the technical skills to be a ballerina is just not available. This was the case with Misty, who started her ballet training late.",0.124
173,"Interesting to read what commentators who understand better have to say.  A.I.G. reared its ugly head at a quiet dinner with an elderly artist in the Village in 2008.  It was tempting to go on a pontificating lecture based on having observed a corporate economic office have exchanges with the Head of A.I.G. the decade before.<br/><br/>Something bad had happened is an understatement, and this former clerk remained silent, only suggesting that the economic fall-out of the Recession was going to impact first on the purchase of Art, as a pleasure and investment.<br/><br/>In meeting later with a financial adviser, he asked where were my life-time savings.  In an annuity, I responded weakly, to which he compared this other insurance company to A.I.G.  Rules have been put in place for this never happening again, I piped up.  A roar on his part and of course I felt like a dolt.<br/><br/>Nothing amusing on this latest update from The Times, and wondering about the long-term effects and delayed reaction we are going to be seeing in the near future.

I appreciate this author's vulnerability with money issues and I am increasingly frustrated, not only by the hawkish nature of the banks to whom I have obligations, but also to those around me who refuse to open up about the struggle that student loans bring, and also the judgement of people my parents' and grandparents' age who offer no help, but plenty of lectures on my responsibility to society.

I have no problem with the perpetuation of strict licensing, trademark, and copyright for the ""life"" of a corporation that brought a creative property into existence and keeps it going. (As literary properties, the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings cycles exist in both a fixed written-word form, and as the multimedia creations like Star Wars: these are exceptionally complicated.)<br/><br/>But the music of Prince was his creation, and did not depend on a corporation for its existence or performance. So in that famous conflict between artist and corporation, I sided with Prince. There was also that awful business with John Fogerty.
