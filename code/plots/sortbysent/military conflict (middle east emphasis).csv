0,Warm congratulations to the Turkish people for mobilizing to preserve their proud heritage of secular democracy. The world is proud of Turkey with its impressive voter turnout that lays the foundation for the ousting of Erdogan and the return of freedom. We wish all Turkish people great success in going forward! ,0.9839
1,"Let me reiterate what I believe is the Republican Pentagon/C.I.A. strategy...............<br/><br/>( I don't drink or drug )<br/><br/>In the 1980's, the C.I.A. supported the mahujadeen and Osama Bin Laden in their fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The Soviets are forever trying to gain warm water ports ( even though ships are now obsolete sitting ducks ) for their Navy.<br/><br/>Then 911 occurred and we invaded Afghanistan to destroy Al Queada led by Bin Laden and then also wound up pitted against the ruling lunatics there, the Taliban. Afghanistan is on the eastern boundary of Iran. So then what? Well, then the Pentagon invaded Iraq on the western boundary of Iran to depose Saddam Hussein and take Iraq away from any Russian occupation from the north, and you guessed it; to keep them from getting a warm water port on the Persian Gulf with adequate supplies of oil.<br/><br/>So now, we are occupying both Afghanistan and Iraq and next on the agenda is Iran in the middle to complete the trifecta of Russian boundary southern flank nations. But the Russians got friendly with Iran probably because they felt threatened by our military on their southern flank.<br/><br/>Now that we have left Iraq and Afghanistan, the heat is off, so Russia helped us make an agreement with Iran not to make weapons. Anyone in Congress who doesn't see this gift of diplomacy and cooling of war is a fool.<br/><br/>The heat is off but could come back if this agreement fails. It really is important. Vote for peace, please. Thanks.",0.9723
2,"Matt Richtel wrote a thoughtful piece on the ""thank you for your service phenomenon"" a few months ago.  ""To some recent vets — by no stretch all of them — the thanks comes across as shallow, disconnected, a reflexive offering from people who, while meaning well, have no clue what soldiers did over there or what motivated them to go, and who would never have gone themselves nor sent their own sons and daughters. To these vets, thanking soldiers for their service symbolizes the ease of sending a volunteer army to wage war at great distance — physically, spiritually, economically. It raises questions of the meaning of patriotism, shared purpose and, pointedly, what you’re supposed to say to those who put their lives on the line and are uncomfortable about being thanked for it.""<br/><br/>Let's recognize that this phenomenon exists, that many vets feel this way and many don't, that people who go out of their way to express feelings of gratitude are in fact expressing feelings of gratitude. Period. Let's also recognize that sincere expressions of gratitude are not a substitute for service to our country which can take many forms, which we all have a duty to perform, and which, sadly, so many of use are not performing. Period.",0.9716
3,"This is the best synopsis of the situation in the Middle East I have ever read. I do have two criticisms, however. The first is the implication that, by failing to act forcefully enough, Obama left a vacuum that was filled by ISIS. But we can only know that by means of hindsight, which as everyone knows, is twenty-twenty. The second is that in addition to calmness and transcendental peace, Zen denotes insight into the hidden inter-relatedness of things. This hidden inte-rrelatedness means that one can never do just one thing. If Obama had acted more forcefully in Syria, he might have prevented a vacuum from forming which ISIS then filled. But there would certainly have been many other side effects that would have been highly undesirable. I was registered as independent, because, although certainly not a Republican, I’ve been pretty much put off by the Democrats. But after Obama declined, even under great pressure, to launch Tomahawk missiles into Syria, I decided to give him my support and registered as Democrat. I consider his reluctance to use violence, his greatest quality and achievement. If any recent politician can be considered Zen, it is Obama.",0.9643
4,"Intelligence analysts always have this problem:Speaking truth to power.Finished intelligence has a lot of art and intuition in it.This implies opinion. All opinions are of equal weight. So disputes. Policy makers or operations C-3 in the military like actionable intelligence or what they call ""facts"".Usually these consumers pick the intelligence that fits their view to back up their decisions or assessments.<br/> This is the problem all intelligence analysts fit. In general the intelligence assessments clash with policy makers or the operations part of a military staff because other inputs are brought to the table by them which are not included in finished intelligence. The decision to invade Iraq was made to change the power balance in the middle east and get a democratic Iraq to support US interests their. In Vietnam we could not have a united communist Vietnam because that would give the Communists a victory in the cold war and empower Communist China.Lots of analysts disagreed with these policy goals because they did not consider them viable.But other factors affected policy makers then the dynamics of the Iraq situation or Vietnam.",0.9597
5,"George Bush won the Iraq war! Obama inherited a stable Iraq, but blew peace and created ISIS when he yanked troops out too soon just for cheap political points and in a desperate attempt to halt the nosedive in his cratering poll numbers.  Obama himself said he was leaving behind a secure, stable, and  self-reliant Iraq. Biden said Iraq would be obama's greatest achievement ",0.9571
6,"I am sure that this writer is correct, but I think he misses the point of this deployment. The purpose is not to save Iraq, it is to save the White House for the Democrats. And I am a Democrat. But that is the only thing that malkes sense. Obama is taking heat for doing nothing-so he is doing as litle as possible and saying it is a solution. <br/><br/>And that may be the right thing to do. I am not sure that the present Iranian backed regime in Iraq is better for the US than ISIS would be. ISIS might even be a good counter-weight. <br/><br/>But I suppose it would not be PC for our government to just say that we are going to let these guys sort out their own government, and we will just cut the best deal we can with the winner. So, as we did in Vietnam, we are pretending that we can alter the outcome. We only give up that charade when it collapses under its own weight, like Vietnam or Nationalist China, or Nicauaga or Cuba.<br/><br/>So do not be irked at Obama-this is SOP.",0.9556
7,"Let's call a spade a spade.  We have been privileged to experience eight years of  a superior president -- graceful, well-spoken, articulate, and militarily effective as Commander in Chief.  (His dispatching of Bin Laden required a surgically precise operation, not a grossly dishonest, ineffective, and obscenely wasteful invasion.)  We are spoiled.  I fervently wish we could have eight more years of Mr. Obama.  None of the Republican bile, xenophobia, and utter mediocrity can persuade me otherwise.  I deeply regret that we find ourselves reviewing the merits of such mediocrities (Trump, Bush, et al.) as the Republicans have put before us.",0.9555
8,"Several years ago, I attended a corporate game of ""paintball"".  The group was divided into 2 teams and there were a couple of female combatants, including one women who had served in the Army.  Over the next two hours, she was clearly the best combatant in the contest, successfully ""killing"" myself and my male teammates many times, while capturing the flag and rarely getting shot herself.  I believe she was a better warrior than most of the combatants she would ever encounter, anywhere.  If they can make it through the required training, why not pick the best, regardless of sex?  Female units seem to work for the Kurds, while striking extra fear into ISIS.",0.9325
9,"I followed the link of the new park lands recommended by the Administration.   I couldn't find the names of the territories appropriated to the Park Service, but the other information on the link was so interesting I got distracted.<br/><br/>Stuff like: "" Provides pay parity for: (1) the Chief of the National Guard Bureau with the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and (2) the senior enlisted advisor to the Chief of the National Guard with the senior enlisted advisors of the Armed Forces.

10,"I didn't realize that Chuck Schumer was the senator from Israel. He obviously is already planning his reelection campaign for the senate and is ingratiating himself to his political supporters in AIPAC, etc., etc. We should not be responsible for military adventures in support of Israel. All of Schumer's supporters here and abroad should be willing to defend their ""homeland"". Let their sons and grandsons join the IDF. Let them be the ""boots on the ground""! No more American blood or treasure spent in support of  this country!",0.9249
11,"I shared many of your concerns initially.  My kids have been in scouts for about 4 years now.  My conclusion: your cub master (or troop master) and a handful of volunteers run the show.  If you like those people, and they are organized and dedicated, it's a great program.  If you talk to these people and don't like them or their position on issues important to you, or if the program just not organized well, run for the hills.  <br/><br/>As I see it, you are joining a pack and its governing council.  There is an entity called the BSA that purports to speak for its membership, but it has little or no  effect on the experience of boys in troops and packs.   <br/><br/>Your local pack essentially has a licensing agreement with national.  Pay the recharter fee and you can buy the books and awards.  That's it.  National gets a little money from the local packs and troops, but they do not set policy for councils.  Some councils have nasty policies and they will flex their muscles about gay issues and religious issues, but yours doesn't. <br/><br/>A good local leader will recognize his/her own power, because much of the value from the program comes from the boots on the ground.  One successful leader of a nationally recognized troop puts it this way: ""They need me more than I need them.""",0.9239
12,"I don't recall there was mass migrations from Libya, Iraq and Syria before 2003. In fact, Libya was one of the more prosperous countries despite a ""dictator"" ruling that country.<br/>The region needed the strongmen. At least for then/now. And it doesn't take a genius to point fingers at powerful outside forces who caused such grave instability in those countries. Yup, they got ""freedom and democracy"". What did Rumsfeld say: ""Freedom is chaotic""?<br/>That's not to say the Muslim countries don't have their share of blame. Indeed, countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia should bear most blame because of the stupid Shia-Sunni divide. But I bet there wouldn't be this level of bloodshed and emigration had the Western corporations not goaded their respective governments to dispense freedom and justice.",0.9162
13,"Actually, the military analogy is perfect. This is the last chance for the old regime to win against the overwhelming tide of the future. The most appropriate description of Pickett's charge would be to apply that said by Pierre Bosquet, a French general observing the Charge of the Light Brigade - ""C’est magnifique, mais ce n’est pas la guerre: c'est de la folie."" (It is magnificent, but it is not war; it is folly.)<br/><br/>Coming next, Custer's last stand?",0.8983
14,"The ""welcome home"" for Vietnam vet as ""national disgrace"" is a tired myth.<br/>I was an Army officer from 1966-69.  I served in Thailand (luckily), not Vietnam, but no one on the street or in an airport could have been aware of that distinction.  I was never - not once - treated poorly.   I got special seats on flights and more than a few free beers from folks ranging from iron worker to hippie.<br/><br/>I don't deny the occasional incident - I saw a few on television.  But the broad assertions are simply false and are part of the larger narrative of soldier as unquestioned and unquestionable hero.  Many soldiers in Vietnam behaved reprehensibly, albeit in a war they didn't choose.  ",0.8952
15,I agree with some of the comments talking about Europeans need to pull together as a result of the two great wars.  I believe the geographic closeness of their countries is another contributing factor.  The only times the U.S. has really had to truly pull together in the last hundred years or so was because of Pearl Harbor (WW II) and the 9/11 attacks.  However even in the case of the 9/11 attacks the togetherness was muted as the war on terror even now is not an “all in” effort as was the case in WW II.<br/><br/>The U.S. for the most part has been spared either the threat or the actual experience of invasion and wholesale destruction.  As such the tendency is to think that we are to some degree indestructible and therefore there is no real need to pull together.  In fact pulling together is really another form of socialism and is contradictory to our core beliefs.  This way of thinking is also a remnant of a society dominated by an agrarian way of life in which most people were truly self-reliant.<br/><br/>The industrial revolution changed all that.  Now only the most ardent survivalist is truly self-reliant but the illusion of a now idealistic self-reliance lives on.  The reality is that the definition of self-reliance has been evolving since the dawn of civilization and in turn so has the need for community. They go hand in hand as they always have.,0.8639
16,"Even in Mesopotamian times, no single government controlled all the Tigris and Euphrates until 1921.  Constantiople has basically controlled the north and Persia the south.  That is how the north became Sunni and the south Shite.<br/><br/>The time has come to recognize that Turkey is the great power in the west.  It has 80 million people and is a member of NATO, the same as Germany and the same we had in 1900 when we established our sphere over Mexico and the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Turkey should establish a quasi-Ottoman Empire hegemony over the Sunni areas on its borders, especially Iraq and Kirkuk .<br/><br/>Instead, of treating a NATO ally of 80 million people as the great power, the US treats the 8 million non-Muslim Israel as the great power.   The fundamentalists in Israel like Netanyahu want unrest in the Middle East to maintain US support in maintaining apartheid.    That will end only when we  threaten to deal with apartheid as we did in South Africa.   <br/><br/>Netanyahu fears Iran so little that he agitated mightly, including through Tom Friedman on these pages, for the overthrow of Saddam--the main bulwark against Iran and the main controller of the Shiites in Iraq. <br/><br/>With Turkey a quasi-Ottoman Empire and Israel a Switzerland and economic power, things might settle down a bit.",0.8578
17,"Thank you for saying this.  The United States is no better than ISIS.  We should stay out of the Arabic country's affairs, which are none of our business.  I'm proud to say that President Obama is doing so.  ",0.8442
18,"I must assume if the deal between the U.S. and Iran fails that Iran will believe it has absolute freedom to pursue its nuclear bomb development. Equally, I must assume the Republican majority will retaliate and call for the U.S. to take military action against Iran. I ask three conditions of our Republican hawks: 1). Re-establish the draft. Our volunteer army cannot fight another war without many additional personnel. Too many current soldiers have served too many tours in the Middle East. 2). All Republican legislators who have sons and daughters of military age or who will be of age during the next decade of fighting (our wars in the Middle East have never been short!) will serve in the military. 3). All costs will be shown in the yearly federal budget.<br/>If 1&amp;2 don't lead to negotiating with Iran I will be astounded! I cannot imagine Americans are ready for a draft or another war in the Middle East. Americans much prefer negotiation to forcing our sons and daughters to fight. ",0.8245

25,"The goal of ISIS and Al Qaeda is power.  They do not care who fights for them (Shiite, Sunni, other) as long as they accumulate the most territory.<br/><br/>Death and torture are used to terrify, in order to bring compliance from, or humiliation to, conquered villages.  <br/><br/>The people of Syria want peace, not war.

26,"Perhaps we could just arm Dick Cheney and George Bush and send them and their friends back into Iraq to straighten out the mess that they created.

The transcript from that interview contained this (and I've read other, similar statements that give me hope):<br/><br/> WATTS: This is a big thing, I mean, because in Yazidi society, it used to be so conservative. And we're only talking about a few years ago. If a single Yazidi woman ran off with a Muslim man, you know, she could be liable to an honor killing. But now so many of their community have been abducted and subjected to this sexual violence that, as a society really, they're having to massively sea change their whole conservative nature. And their religious leaders have actually been at the forefront of this from very early on in the process saying we have to welcome our girls back.

You know what they say about making assumptions ...<br/><br/>Since you are a ""non-Armenian"" Angeleno who just by coincidence happens to have it in for the Turks due to events which transpired over a century ago under an extinct empire, I would make a counter-suggestion to you to read about the ethnic cleansing engaged in by Armenian gangs and irregulars in 1915 in the city of Van located in eastern Turkey where they massacred the entire Muslim population of the city ahead of the advancing Russian army. Estimates of the Armenian carnage of both Turkish and Kurdish inhabitants runs anywhere from 40,000 to 80,000 civilians killed. BTW don't take my word for it; since we are writing in the Travel section, hop on a plane and fly to Van sometime. The burnt out Muslim section of the city has been left intact so that people such as yourself can come and see the truth with their own eyes.<br/><br/>So before talking about genocide, you may wish to consider whether the Armenians themselves did not engage in it.

Even as a Korean, and not someone who is in anyway related to Turks, I can see what this US media propaganda chooses to either display to the public or not.  For instance, it is obvious that the PKK is an ally for the US in what it is trying to accomplish.  The US basically wants another Saddam, except this time, leaving much of the stability issue to be rested in the hands of the Kurds, who seem to be the most compliant lapdogs in the Middle East.  Yet the problem with America's support of the Kurds is also the fact that the Kurds have not, and still do not behave much better than the ISIS in terms of getting their message for independence across.  Within the Turkish border the extremist Kurds among the PKK have been constantly committing the same terrorist acts that the ISIS is basically doing in the Middle East.  While media outlets in the EU constantly cover the PKKs horrendous acts in Turkey, in the US, the media never reports anything that would hinder the support of the public for Washington's interest: Kurds.  In the end, Washington's support for the Kurds will be a much bigger headache in the long run.

Also, according to Iraqi exiles who met with Bush before the invasion, Bush didn't know  that there were Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq and didn't understand the difference between them.<br/><br/>This disaster should be laid squarely at the feet of Bush, Cheney and the rest of these neocons, including McCain and Graham, who were wrong about everything.<br/><br/>Instead, the media, including you, is doing their bidding and allowing them to get away with this garbage. They opened this Pandora's Box. I would like for you and other journalists to do a real analysis and come up with some real solutions to this mess.<br/><br/>Finally, I think it was a victory for American workers that the trade bill was defeated.

Now I haven't too many other sayings in my 46.8 years of life on this planet but that one has always stuck with me because it's visceral honesty is both unyielding and irrefutable as history so eloquently and tragically demonstrates.  What has really been resolved in the aftermath of the conflict?  We'll without the smoke screen of an international conflict it became apparent what our corporations, banks, and securities firms in cahoots with the real estate industry was really doing to our economy.  Real citizens lives were financially destroyed for the profit margins of a few already wealthy people to become wealthier, go figure.  Yet the victims across the Atlantic are mentioned as mere statistics and historic ammunition to further conversations mired in a refusal to come to any kind of coherent narrative as to why the excess destruction of war is so detrimental when you can't point out to any concrete turning points in geopolitical affairs regarding all things U.S. Middle East.  Saddam, Qaddafi, Osama, and dozens others killed and yet now we have ISIS/ISIL, whose macabre lust for the videoriffic surpasses all of their predecessors.

We consider Islamist terrorists to be an enemy without a state which can be held accountable for their acts, instead of criminals who commit crimes whose proximate causes are political. It leads governments to treat the populations from which the emerge to be benign enemies only awaiting some trigger to make them malignant actors in these atrocities. The way to address the size of the problem of confronting the terrorists it to reduce their number to something that is limited enough by circumstances to allow reasonable guesses of who are most likely to act.
