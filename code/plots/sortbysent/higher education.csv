0,"Tests are a good teaching tool, help motivate students to master critical elements of the material being taught, but they become insidious when used as the sole means of grading or otherwise judging competency.  For me, the real question is:  What is done with the results of these tests?  If they are used as the sole basis for grading, determining whether students pass to the next grades, or rating the competency of the teachers, that is very wrong.  Some students are quite competent, but don't test well, due to anxiety or any number of other issues.  Conversely, there are students who know how to score well on ""multiple guess"" tests, but who really aren't competent on the subject matter.  Multiple choice tests also don't show whether students have good oral skills, whether they listen to others, build on ideas, and arrive at new insights, or whether they will remember any of the subject matterafter the test.  Accordingly, tests must be only one tool among many in helping teachers motivate and grade students (and in helping schools motivate and grade teachers.<br/><br/>As to the last question, it's great to include a few problems that stretch the minds of the test takers, and that only a few will get right.  The correct answer is not in the text, and is not a very satisfactory answer, but it is a reasonable interpretation of the story and clearly the best alternative presented.  So, right answers will help identify students with exceptional talents (including good guessing).",0.9901
1,"I am grateful for the high quality of reporting on education in The Times. And this piece is a good example. But I wish this paper spent more space on the educational plight of the average American and less on the elite. <br/><br/>I suspect that the staff at the The Times has more brushes with students who aspire to the most elite institutions, and I also am certain the staff has more exposure to graduates of these institutions. But that's not the average American's--or even the above-average American's--experience. <br/><br/>I know you do plenty of pieces on the 99% of us who do not get Ivy League educations, but there is an inordinate number of articles about said ""League."" What made me notice most of all this time was the title, ""A Prudent College Path."" I'd assumed it was something I might read for my intelligent and successful teenager, but, alas, it was for the three people in his class who could possible benefit from this advice, no more than that. <br/><br/>While elite colleges have rightly earned strong reputations as institutions of learning, the press would do well to note how often they are attracted to giving these super-star schools and their super-star students too much attention. Perhaps fewer articles about these exceptions and more articles about the masses would  better inform a greater  number of us.",0.9899
2,"It's easy for you to look at this district! How about looking into the going's on in Districts 20 , 21, and 22 in southern Brooklyn where politicians like Felder, Greenfield, and Hikind hold sway?! While the districts themselves do an otherwise fine job educating their charges, essentially because of populations who value education, you can be sure they take care of their supposedly rigidly orthodox brethren and their Yeshivas first! Often at a loss to ALL our kids! Simple case in point is that I understand FDR high school which encompasses those districts recently celebrated its' glorious 50th Anniversary! Councilman Greenfield and his mishpocha staff were invited to their Sunday banquet, indicated they would come, and FDR's burgeoning alumni association set aside almost five hundred dollars for a Kosher table! Greenfield and his staff not only didn't show up, they never even sent their regrets! The alumni association would have been happy to allocate those monies for scholarships for our kids!...It will be interesting to see what these politicos do when one of southern Brooklyn's other high schools, and a much more famous one at that, New Utrecht celebrates its historic 100th Anniversary this October, and many of its notable Hollywood alumni, a number landsmen like myself, fly in from the west coast to glorify in their proud eastern Bensonhurst and Borough Park roots, and see that their old neighborhoods have essentially been turned into political fiefdoms and ghettoes?!

3,"High level US corporate life seems insane - and of course long hours are built into some high level professional roles in Europe.... But attitudes to work and balancing career and family seem more advanced in Europe - anecdotally at least - career breaks and job sharing are common in Ireland in the public sector.... The working week is capped and holidays are long in France.... German working life is more balanced..... And while the economists among you might point out that work life balance must be great in Greece, but unaffordable.... Nonetheless there most be a societal happy medium that's achievable that allows both parents to participate in the workforce, while having a home life..... By the way I agree with a comment below that examples drawn from elite universities graduates are not representative of the US at large..... They probably represent your readership.... but perhaps your readership need to be reminded that there is a world outside their upper-middle class environments..... How do working class American women cope with family life and child care??? ",0.9865

With teacher shortages putting pressure on schools to hire, there's no guarantee that teachers will be experienced, good at teaching, or have any idea what they're doing. But experience doesn't always make a good teacher. I've had teachers that are so experienced in their subject, have been in their position for over 20 years, and are very nice, but they weren't good at conveying information. I've also had teachers that were only a few years out of college that were very effective in their teaching methods. Experience helps, but it isn't as important as being able to convey information, which is the main task in teaching. I'm sure the young teachers being brought in will be able to adapt and rise to the occasion, maybe with their learning days so close behind they'll be more able to put themselves in a student mindset. Rather than worrying about students effectively learning, I think greater concern for the future would be in insuring that this lack of teachers doesn't cause an over abundance in years to come, with young people seeing the great job market in the profession and all jumping into teaching school.",0.9865
5,"This article was about an exceptional individual creating a program of excellence that offers kids an opportunity, through participation in sports, to aspire to higher ideals. The parents portrayed in the article support not only  their children's participation in the program, but the program itself, including materially. <br/><br/>I for one think that Coach Bandura is an exceptional human being, and reading this article challenges me to seek in what ways I too could contribute to a better society by using him as a role model. I speak as a university professor, but also as a father whose kid has been through grad school successfully, and who was not ashamed to trust her to capable teachers and mentors, realizing that I did not possess nearly all the skills to successfully homeschool her, as you seem to be suggesting, to the same satisfactory outcomes. I thank God for exceptional people like Coach Bandura, and people like that who I can look up to. If that shows lack of shame, so be it.",0.9848
6,"I have taught maximum security inmates in the prison system for a number of years and I support offering courses to those that desire to take them. Most of the students I have had were very good students, highly motivated and they performed very well. And yes the statistics for such a group regarding recidivism are fairly good.<br/><br/>But for balance a few realities should be pointed out. These students are self-selected. They are for the most part interested and motivated to change and better themselves. It is not correct to infer that if all inmates are simply offered college classes that there will be a dramatic reduction in those returning, because many are not interested in changing and no one can predict when they will be. <br/><br/>So these programs have the very real possibility of helping 10-30% of the inmates get their life turned around, which is a good thing of course, but  again it's because they want to change in a fundamental sense. For the majority who are not yet at a point they actually want to follow the rules, there will be no such change.<br/><br/>Inmates don't change because you and I want them to, or we offer them opportunities to change, they change only when they decide to themselves. So it is good to have educational programs, it's also good to have some sense of the bigger picture.",0.9799
7,"For so many of us when we are younger we receive praise for our obvious gifts we are pushed in that direction. We think that is the way we ""should"" go, I mean after all, it would be the easy road. I taught gifted kids for awhile in a high school. I always cautioned them about their futures, reminding them that they have to make choices that suits them and not their parents or others. I was always good in math, and everyone assumed I would go that direction. I even got into college as a math major. But I looked around and said ""I couldn't possibly do this the rest of my life"", and changed my major. Fortunately for me, I had a variety of choices because of many passions. I eventually taught 18 different art and humanities courses over a 35 year career. To make a long story very short, one of my courses ""Puppetry"" was packed with gifted students looking for a way to express themselves, along with football players, art students, math majors, etc. I used to say it was a good life experience, all working together in close quarters, putting on a show, and laughing their butts off in the process. Life is short, do what makes you happy, money will follow. The important thing is the process, product is always an outcome.",0.9774
8,"I wonder if ""the best jobs, or the grad schools"" are even the way to go. I traded a crack at that world for a second-string grad program and a non-stellar academic career. I have been employed 23 years by the same employer, own a house and a rental house, started a small business I will pursue in retirement, and travel a lot.<br/><br/>No I don't have a skyscraper condo, a beach house, or a Maserati. But I'm comfortable and live a great life. I wonder how many who focus on being among the 1% of business or academe ""like laser beams"" end up really happy? You might ask your sons ""what is it you REALLY want to do?""  Too few parents, in this age of anxiety, do that.",0.977
9,"Fully agree with the elimination of obstacles preventing teachers from migrating from one state to another, but getting rid of meaningless additional licensing requirements will not resolve the problem, because pensions are generally not portable, and they are also structured in such a way as to reward longer term employees of a state or a district. This is a big problem, not only for teachers, but for their families, because spouses are tied to a particular state, as well, and others, like my single and childfree sister who is the sole remaining immediate family member in our home state with my very-old parents, will have to remain there even when she is the only one left, rather than moving closer to her siblings and their families.<br/><br/>The concern about doing the same thing after decades as on Day One is misplaced. This occurs in many respected professions, like medicine or dentistry. The main problem is that, regardless of what are viewed as lax entry requirements to the profession, most people do not realize how hard teaching really is or how much time and natural talent it requires. <br/><br/>As an aside, I would note that, while requirements for entry to medical school are still quite high, there are plenty of loopholes such as outright nepotism and Affirmative Action that permit markedly less-well-qualified candidates to slip through. It's rather shocking, frankly.",0.9758
10,"A reporter should be embedded with college students at prestige schools for a period of time, so that they could better assess where the ""stress"" is coming from.  I'm a faculty member at a prestige school, and though I give students plenty of opportunities to work, work, work on their papers and data exercises, offer draft writing options and lots of office hours, relatively few students take me up on that.  One would think that working on assignments over time, with the prof who will grade you, would be less stressful than pulling an all nighter.  I also see students who are way over-committed with  activities, are in leadership roles for umpteen organizations, but who save doing course readings till study week.  No wonder they are stressed!  In the ""real world,"" or the work world at least, work happens continuously.  But students have somehow learned to do episodic work, and seem to fill in a lot of time with social things.  Do employers really care if you were a leader in 3 organizations or 5?  How can you have the time to be a good student then?  And what if one has to work?  I just think the desire to be involved with everything has gotten out of hand.  On top of lack of sleep, and yes, parental pressure, students are stressed - but many are not good users of the services that exist, or do not take the time to go to office hours or talk with the faculty members who are there to help them figure out what they are there for - to learn new and challenging material.",0.9745
11,"""Suicide on Campus and the Pressure of Perfection""<br/>Growing up, Hannah Montana told me, ""Everybody makes mistakes"" and that, ""Nobody's perfect"". However, we strive for perfection even though we know perfection is impossible. It is this drive and desire to be perfect that make ""small setbacks” seem more like huge disappointments. As quite a perfectionist, I have high expectations for myself. When I received my first B ever at the end of my junior year, I was very upset, mostly at myself. I had tainted my straight-A record, I ruined my chance of attending my dream college, and my GPA and rank were a complete loss. However, not only had I failed myself, I had failed my parents. I feared their reaction to my report card, anticipating the disappointing looks, the questions, the lectures.<br/>In my strive for perfection, I failed to see the bigger picture and focused on my “small setback”. Scelpo states that such setbacks should give “that feeling of needing to try harder next time”, but my perfection made me obsess over them. Instead of feeling determined to try harder, I wanted to give up. This all or nothing mindset of perfection is the driving force behind the stress that causes students to commit suicide. As cliche as it is, nobody's perfect, just like Hannah Montana sang, and everyone-students and parents alike- need to be able accept imperfection. Although we should set high standards for ourselves, we need to be reminded that being imperfect is in fact, okay. ",0.9709
12,"Does Your School Do a Good Job of Teaching Sex Ed?<br/>I picked this article because i feel as if it takes on a very important topic. I personally do not think that schools do a good job at teaching students about sex education. What they focus on (at least the schools I have went to) is the possible consequences of having sex; like sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Although there is the occasional ""make sure you wear a condom"" lecture, but they insist on staying abstinent. Yes, this is important information to make students aware of the dangers of having sex and it is still an awkward subject. Many people will agree that the sex conversation should be left up to the parents, not the teachers. I think the reason why it is this way is because it is the teacher’s job to give the students inarguable  information, facts, to keep and it is the student's job to take it in, and if they want, ask questions out of curiosity (not like this happens often). But let’s face it, at least in high school, there are going to be students willing to experiment anyway. What schools should should also be teaching along with the consequences are things like what to do if you want to have a child, rather than how to prevent having one. I believe by doing this it would make a huge difference in the youth's knowledge on sex and make us more well rounded on the topic.",0.9691
13,"New York City Task Force Targets Cheating by Teachers and Principals<br/><br/>This is the second article I have came upon regarding cheating by school officials. Cheating has been an ongoing issue for years in many different schools and has just come into view. Take for example, the tampering of third-grade exams or the school on Brooklyn that didn't provide actual instruction for students from different subjects but instead gave the students just packets to pass a class. Carmen Farina, the school chancellor, is taking a good step forward by addressing the problem to fellow educators to stop the issue, saying there will be zero tolerance for educators who disobey academic policies. Recently, the latest investigation was in the William Cullen Bryant High school. In response, to this investigation being open the State Legislature is observing the Mayor Bill de Blasio and Michael R. Bloomgerg but then noticed this problem increased when Mr.Bloomberg was in charge. Now, one of the regulations that the State Legislature will have, be that the teachers can't grade their own student's tests which is a good step toward solving this growing issue. It's great to see that the Education Department has taken action now and is trying to crack down on these cases. Now, they will be checking for any unusual items, like too much credits or too much graduates who graduated than were expected too. Hopefully this growing issue will slowly decrease until it fades away.",0.9673

15,"I think there are two different topics.  I think you are right in the sense of depression being a common ailment that needs to be addressed.  Awareness on mental illness and education about it most definitively have to change.<br/>But I also think, that the author brings up an important topic.  There is a book called ""The Price of Privilege"" which talks about this issues.  You are right in the sense that it is not only on this demographic that suicide happens, but I do think many of this suicides are preventable if parents were not living through their kids.   Many of this kids are pleasing their parents or are in Ivy League schools to please their parents or to be a part of this elite group just because their parents want them to be there.    Not every kid has the chops to attend this schools in terms of academics or giftedness. Not only that, not every kid has the desire to go to this schools.  It is not everyones happiness to be a CEO or to be a part of this.  There are many successful business men and many entrepreneurs who did not go to this colleges who live amazingly great lives, not necessarily measured in terms of money.   The pressure for the kids is starting since before High School,  the options of the IB programs, the extra credits. It is overwhelming for those who are not ready or are not in the world to be battling the best of the best left and right.

Testing mania also demoralizes teachers and discourages talented people from joining the field.<br/><br/>Standardized testing can have a meaningful role, helping students, teachers, and parents gauge their progress.

22,"How math is taught in the U.S. is fraught with problems. When our daughter first learned to multiply, she was taught multiple methods. The problem was not that she didn't understand the content in class, but that she age-appropriately forgot how to apply what she learned to her homework. Teachers did not provide any guidance or materials for parents who could assist with learning. Moreover, her parents had to google, 'matrix-method multiplication'.There is nothing wrong with parents helping and supporting their children with learning. As a parent, my concern is that most math teachers do not teach a systematic approach that will prepare them for higher math.  After changing schools, we were lucky to find a teacher who approached teaching math in a logical and systematic way. This had the added assurance that the gaps or holes from lack of mastery on basic concepts would not line up when learning higher level math. That is not to say that our daughter was not traumatized by her early experience when the math teacher yelled at her for not using the multiple methods of multiplication. As she goes into 10th grade, she is much more prepared to tackle advanced Algebra. We as parents have no regrets about intervening on the anxiety created by how math was taught.",0.9288

I would expand the model for dealing with struggling children used by special education schools who deal with the kids who have similar issues but have been channeled into a mental health/behavioral sector rather than into a punitive sector.  There are particular techniques, like collaborative problem solving, that help, and many kids who act out have underlying issues like trauma, anxiety, and depression that need to be addressed.

34,"This week, I came across the article “Today’s Exhausted Superkids” by Frank Bruni.  Noting that this article would be about students like me, I immediately became intrigued.  As a teenager, I obviously have no way of knowing what school life was like anymore than 10 years ago. Thus, I can only assume that education today is even more time consuming and stressful. However, I agree with the article when it states that kids now a days are on a race to become successful, and that race contains no breaks and very little sleep.  I know many people my age take adderall to catch up in this so called race, and sadly, those who do not may fall behind. One classmate of mine even fell asleep at the wheel, hitting a telephone pole.  If his younger brother was in the passenger seat, he would have died.  Students nowadays are so kean on success that their lack of sleep is risking their lives, as well as the ones they love. Although school can be easier in modern day with the enhances in technology, our workload has increased and the standards we are given have been raised.  So I must wonder, is it worth it? Is all this rigorous work and little sleep worth the good grades and possible acceptance into ivy leagues?  With such an awful economy we are already worried if we will even get a job when we graduate from college, so we wonder, is giving up our childhood worth it? ",0.9048

They are its antithesis.<br/><br/>I have seen too many incompetents shamelessly using tenured status to cheat their students out of the education that they deserve.  A feckless researcher is a lost opportunity; a terrible teacher is a disaster.  There are relatively few of these disasters, but they have dire consequences.  They can have serious negative effects that ripple onward for generations.  We are going to need to vastly improve the critical thinking skills of all people if we are to even survive much longer on our fragile planet.<br/><br/>Don't mistake me- I am not suggesting that we adopt a business model of evaluation.  We must avoid the conflation of productivity with profit or we will lose the precious safeguard of freedom that critical thinking provides. Intellectuals should lead the charge on tenure reform- otherwise they cede the field to politicians and short-sighted fools.

229,"Doctors, which is what Harvard alum Miller is (MD, PhD), are notoriously egotistical; it helps them be able to make life and death decisions. It also makes them terrible judges of other sciences and scientists. The worst patient a doctor can have is a PhD physicist; it gives their huge egos quite the tremors of insecurity. Doctors memorize; PhDs comprehend.",-0.8979
230,"Blaming the parents of public school students for the situation in East Ramapo is akin to blaming Black parents in the pre-integration South for the separate and unequal distribution of resources that prevailed until long after Brown v Board was handed down.  As a demographic minority, the parents in NY simply don't have the numbers to undo the damage done.  And, considering that the school board operates behind closed doors, absent any public input, the cards are stacked against the possibility of any grass-roots reform.  The bullying tactics used by the board is well-documented, and this clear misuse of power must come to an end.  ",-0.9169
231,"""Today's Exhausted Superkids""<br/>I found this article the most interesting, because I found that I can relate to this almost all the time.  The article talks about how kids in this generation are getting 5-6 hours of sleep (instead of 8-10), and how it's affecting their lives in general.  Personally, last school year I got 5-6 hours of sleep almost every school night.  Only on Saturday night, will I get at least 9 hours of sleep.  This is due to the amount of stress I was going through to ace my exams and get all my homework done.  I know I'm not the only student going through this, but it makes me sad that there are thousands of students going through this too.  We should be getting more sleep, but when stress kicks in, there's no way to kick it out.  ""..In communities where academic expectations run highest, the real culprit is panic: about acing the exam, burnishing the transcript, keeping up with high-achieving peers"" (Today's Exhausted Superkids, Frank Bruni).  This quote is so relatable. This real life, and this is what kids go through on a daily basis.  We're always worrying about getting our homework done, showing up to our sport practices/training, trying to be a straight A student, etc..  Especially when our families have high expectations for us, because we feel the need to satisfy those expectations. I hope that by reading this article, teens realize that we should focus on our education, but we should also focus on ourselves too.",-0.917
232,"Two thoughts: As an educator, I find it maddening when people say, ""Our education system needs to be reformed to deliver better results."" That is the kind of short-term thinking that the author elsewhere criticizes, which has led to so many ridiculously bad choices, like spending 20% of the school year testing students -- and then doing almost nothing with the data you accrue, except to threaten to fire teachers. Education reform should move to make it more like medicine. We don't tell doctors, ""Start killing fewer patients"" without doing funded studies that figure out what actually works in preventing patient deaths. It's not like doctors are excited when patients die, or teachers are happy when kids don't learn. And we don't punish doctors who work with high-risk populations (such as shaming at them when their drug-abusing homeless patients don't show up for follow-up visits.) Education reform starts with good, solid research, not with hand-wringing (and American teachers are dealing with much more childhood poverty than most of Europe.) A lot of things, including the implementation of the Common Core, were woefully short on solid research. They are guesses, at best.<br/><br/>My second question: I've often argued that a simple way to fix worker pay problems would be an economy of scale: the bigger your company, the higher your minimum wage must be. So as you succeed, then by default, your workers would, too. Is there something wrong with my pet idea?",-0.9271
233,"Sorry, I don't think the questions are so tough or convoluted. I agree that q6 is a little less clear and you need to exclude the clearly wrong answers before getting the correct one.  On the lion's share of questions 90%+ answered them correctly.  Some questions require inferences and some are more concrete.  Standardized tests should not be the all or nothing of school and student assessment but they are a vital component.  The comments on this article are overwhelmingly critical of test taking.  Less than two weeks ago The Times had an article on ultra-Orthodox schools that provide limited instruction in what most people feel is necessary for a well-educated populace.  Throughout the country parents are home schooling their children with little to no oversight.  After having been a student for 20 years and a teacher now for 20+ years, I find standardized essays to be far less credible than multiple choice tests.  With a bow to Winston Churchill, while multiple choice tests may be a bad form of testing they are the least bad.",-0.9389
234,"""First, the political correctness on campuses is virtually all from the intolerant left."" I can tell you from personal experience that this simply is not true. I saw a speaker who had criticized the religious/social action group ""Promise Keepers"" literally run off my campus by angry students who threatened his safety. I saw a provocateur from the group ""FIRE"" attempt to bait his (female, untenured) instructors into disciplining him so that he could whine ""oppression of free speech"" by writing threatening and sexually harassing passages in his assignments. I saw one of my colleagues bullied and threatened by a student and her parents for mentioning evolution. Take off that halo and go look in the mirror, my friend.  ",-0.9435
235,"I'm a teacher, not a journalist. There are only two reasons to enter primary or secondary teaching today: an irrational desire to teach children, or an inability to find better employment. There are two reasons to leave teaching: the parents and the administrators. I would love to believe that my union supports me, protects me from the irrational demands of administrators who exist only to protect their jobs, but that's hardly the case. Further, my union protects me only from getting fired, not from the consequences of bad parenting; the helicopters who threaten me if their child doesn't get an A, and those who have so abandoned their children that violent rebels sit in my class. <br/><br/>With that as a foundation, is it no surprise that we end up with two types of teachers: the incompetent and the burnt out? The competent ones, the intellectually curious, those who are passionate about education leave after a few years. We're left with the incompetent and the burnt out (me). This, then reinforces the negative cycle; the breakroom is the most toxic place in the school. <br/><br/>the only solution to this, and will take years and a political bludgeon, is to raise the bar on teaching. We force the teaching schools to flunk out those who become marginal teachers. Remove the financial incentive to the universities to go from a D in calc I to the education school. Create a corps of teachers who are adequately educated, informed and motivated to push back against the insane bureaucracies. ",-0.9481
236,"Excellent points by those who really know what goes on in today's schools. It is undoubtedly all for naught, as the money people have bought their way into the classroom and the administrators have drunk the kool-aid.<br/><br/>A few points to add:<br/><br/>Students run wild. Its not their fault. There are no expectations otherwise.<br/><br/>Kids are tested, teachers are graded. Huh?<br/><br/>All of the demands are on the teacher, few if any on the kids.<br/><br/>New philosophy of education: Do more with less and demand better results.<br/><br/>Teachers must do what kids want, kids do what they want.<br/><br/>Grades matter, learning doesn't.<br/><br/>If a student deserves a grade they don't like, administration will go over the head of the teacher and change it to a 'better' grade.<br/><br/>Parents used to support teachers, today some student's parents threaten teachers, no matter what the student does.<br/><br/>Racism is not suspending students in a district that is 90% minority, racism is handing out worthless diplomas knowing full well that the student has done virtually nothing to earn it.<br/><br/>If a student may not graduate because they did nothing for four years, calls will be made and pressure will be placed on teachers to make sure the student walks across the stage.<br/><br/>Teachers are scared to death to speak out for fear of being targeted as a 'malcontent' or worse, no matter the merits of their complaint.<br/><br/>Obviously, this list could be endless. If you are thinking of going into teaching, DON'T. You will be a scapegoat for all that ails society.",-0.958
237,"Lots of people are commenting that they got the answers right - but only by being successful at trying to think about what the test maker was thinking.<br/><br/>This is exactly the point: no way should standardized test for kids be like this.  Reading comprehension is just that - no more and no less.  It's not ""Test maker comprehension.""  Any time it's about outfoxing the dumb question, the question is automatically bad, and should be tossed.  Period.<br/><br/>In professional certification exams, questions that consistently fail are tossed: it's not fair to the test taker, and not an accurate assessment of skill.  If it's not good for adults, why should it be good for kids?",-0.9704
238,"This is truly pathetic.  We as a nation have a disruptive society and distracted - or even disfunctional homes.  A large percentage of kids come to school burdened with so much that distracts from learning.  Even the ones from better homes often arive at school with no zeal for learning... and even less discipline.<br/><br/>""Who cares!  Not our problem!  Teachers teach, so make them teach!""  This has been our motto for years now: ""Poor performing kids are ALWAYS the teacher's problem.  They are overpaid with our taxes,  underworked, and uninspiring - and don't even get started about teacher's unions or pensions!  Kill both of these ""perks"" and make teachers WORK for a living!""<br/><br/>Sound familiar?  It's been America's attitude towards teachers for at least the last ten years, with attitudes before that not so great either.  Their reality is far different: underfunded, overworked, grossly over-managed in a constant hyper-critical environment.  Teachers have their hands tied when it comes to discipline and course content.  We teach to tests, not to topics.  Teachers monitor what's politically correct, lest they say something different from what Jonny's pastor said on Sunday. Finally, teachers often spend thousands of their own money properly equipping their classrooms.  What other profession makes you buy the supplies that should already be on hand?<br/><br/>Then we wonder why we have a shortage? Seriously?  Most people wouldn't last a week!  We worked real hard to make this shortage a reality!",-0.9747
239,"Frank<br/>    I have a few thoughts I'd like to share if I may<br/>1) Teacher pay. Don't most people do some research when they look for a job as far as salary, salary increases, opportunities for advancement, if post graduate work will increase their opportunities?<br/>I get tired of hearing teacher's complain about pay. Did you become a teacher to make a difference or to get rich.<br/>Second,teacher's should be given more say. But what if that teachers method's or principles conflict with the mission of the district. What then? They monitor them? Using what standard? Don't you run the risk of having multiple concepts being presented within the same school district?<br/>Third, I don't care what anyone says tenure protects bad teachers. Look at the Chicago school system. They have some of the highest paid teachers in the country and even though the city has a -$430 million dollar deficit and all the other departments froze salaries the teachers demanded and got a raise. This wasn't about the kids. This was about them and they're I don't give a damn about the city's position, I want mine regardless mentality.They have among the highest drop out rates and lowest test scores in the country.  Better pay does NOT ensure better teachers.<br/>Having said that kids today do not respect teachers. They do not respect their authority, what they represent. If a teacher runs the risk of confronting  a kid, he Is often looked at as a bully or the aggressor and has to fight for his job.  Thanks but no thanks",-0.989
