0,"The point of dialogue is not simply to share points of view or experiences. We have now reached a point in time where real structural change is critical, not only to black people but to the nation as a whole. So for me dialogue needs to focus on what policies continue to reflect and reinforce white domination and how we can come together to change them. In high school I was part of a ""Human Relations Club."" That was over 50 years ago and its premise was since we lived such separate lives it would be good to come together and share things we had in common.<br/><br/>While that's all well and good, it won't change the policies of mass incarceration and the racialized manner manner it which it is carried out. Nor will it change policing policies to require policing methods based on service, community involvement and community cooperation. Some police forces do this and have few racial incidents, but many don't. That needs to change.<br/><br/>Health care is crucial to all but as a commodity it is measured out with profits and privilege in mind. This literally costs black lives, as do environmental policies that overload minority communities with toxic materials.<br/><br/>I welcome a dialogue about race on these issues. As we work to better understand just how racialized many public policies have become I expect that many whites will proclaim that they never knew this was being done in their name. This struggle for justice for all of us is the new common ground for better racial understanding.",0.9832
1,"Anne, you have some unusual friends!<br/><br/>I founded an organization in college called HAPA (the half Asian people's association) in a playful riff on both the proliferation of ethnic-specific student associations and the Hawaiian pidgin word for 'half.' Of the many scores of multi-racial students I interacted with, none identified solely, or primarily, as white. Almost all identified as X-American, where the ""X"" might be African, Asian, Mexican, etc. Many identified as bi/multi-racial. Of course this was at a very diverse school, and differences were celebrated, so there was safety in differentness. And that really seems to be the root of the difference. People often identify with the culture in which they were raised. Asian Americans whether biracial or not often work with and live near many Caucasians. They don't identify as 'white' but feel perfectly comfortable operating in that world. Uniquely, African- and Native-Americans still often live in segregated fashion, so whether someone is bi-racial black-white or 'just black', they often spend inordinate time around the black community, which naturally shapes their identify.<br/><br/>I think your friends' response is very far from the mainstream with respect to how most bi-racial Asian Americans would respond.",0.978
2,"Claudia Rankine: Thank you so much for telling the truth about this story. The best quote which I am going to frame in my head and on my wall is: “The notable difference between black excellence and white excellence is white excellence is achieved without having to battle racism.”<br/>I have been through that, and it is even more difficult if you are black with an accent. They approve of the accent of the Europeans but not the non-Europeans. One of the best articles ever!!!",0.9585
3,"The whole premise that culture can be stolen or borrowed is based on ignorance of history. Should native Americans give up technology and stylistic influences that are post 1500? Should African Americans give up the tempered musical scale developed in Europe? It seems that only whites are being asked not to borrow, and then only certain popular themes like dance moves or hair styles. <br/><br/>Even worse, who owns culture? Do you need to have a certified pedigree or DNA analysis to adopt cultural themes? Or a politically correct stance before you can, say, buy certain clothes or dance a certain way? Or did you have to grow up in a certain neighborhood? All this flies in the face of our basic American value - freedom to express yourself, freedom of speech. My clothes, my accent, my music, my furniture, etc. is my way of expressing me, politically correct or not, and THAT is the core of what makes me American. ",0.9465
4,"There seem to be some parallels with the affirmative action debate in the US, particularly this: ""Many Patels, Hardik included, readily agree that the government should give extra help to poor families, regardless of caste. They object, however, to India’s quota system precisely because it is built around caste, not economic status."" <br/><br/>It's a commonly heard argument against affirmative action in the US, that economic class should be used rather than race. That a parallel argument is made in each society might point to some common root cause, namely the deflection of the respective privileged groups. <br/><br/>I wonder if that argument exists to sanitize their opposition to caste quotas or affirmative action, while seeking to minimize the role of the caste system or racism in limiting people's opportunities. In essence, saying that really economics alone is what's important, as if someone who is relatively affluent but is from a lower caste in India or black in the United States has the same opportunities as a person of higher caste or a white person respectively. <br/><br/>That each privileged group is more comfortable with economics as the cause of inequality than caste or race might suggest just the opposite.",0.946
5,"Race is the lie that has been used to justify genocide and many ""well meaning"" white people have historically and to this day fell for it. Ethnicity is a diferent type of classiification based on culture, language and cultural geography, shared social practices and geographic origin. Many white Americans are just flat out confused when it comes to race except when they are committing race-based crimes against humanity, whereas Ms. Dolezal appears to be one of the least confused about race. Genetically, we are all mutts and can interbreed, hence there is only one race, the human race. Spread the love, not lies and war. Peace. ",0.9243
6,"Racism can be applied to other people of color. In my community, with a growing population of Hispanics, we see bigoted attitudes towards them. (African Americans are a small population in Utah.) And yet... when people are polled here, the majority think race relations are good. Their opinions do not reflect the experience of many Hispanics. Perhaps they think the questions only apply to African Americans. Most people want to believe that they are not racist. Recently a seemingly tolerant, ell-educated friend returned from his annual vacation in  Newport Beach and remarked that ""Mexicans"" are taking over California. He would be surprised to be called racist. But he is. We are having our own controversy over Dixie State University in St. George, Utah. Many people love their Rebels.",0.8992
7,"There is a a very simple reason why Trump is popular with the Republican base. Like other plutocrats such as the Kochs and the Waltons, he has spent his entire life perfecting the moral justification of unearned wealth. The corollary of that life quest is the moral justification of the poverty of those who do not inherit wealth whether they work or not. The white Republican base never tires of hearing implicit moral justification of white privilege and black poverty. That racial rhetoric, blunt or coded, is second nature to Trump.",0.872
8,Nearly 60 years ago my parents accepted a request that they enroll my sister and me in a majority-Black YWCA summer program for low-income girls.  We two white sisters were meant to be part of a desegregation effort.  My life was immeasureably enriched by this introduction to children whom I otherwise would never have met.  It predisposed me to be far more open-minded and interested in subsequent studies in boarding school and my universities.  Thank goodness I wasn't confined to the homogeneous environment of my own cultural and economic background!,0.8707
9,"This is not the first instance of a ""race change"" from white to black. Fans of the old ""Kudzu"" comic strip may remember that Nasal T. Lardbottom, the Cartman like character of that strip had a ""race change operation,"" so that he could dunk basketballs effortlessly and ""high-five"" without injuring himself. <br/><br/>One of the funniest ""Kudzu"" strips showed Lardbottom in his High School  language lab, where other students were practicing their French and Spanish, repeating ""Ebonics"" idioms: ""What it is!,"" ""What it be!"" and ""Yo Momma!"" Maybe Rachel Dolezal, like Nasal T. Lardbottom, could star in her own comic strip on the ""race changing"" experience!",0.8679
10,"Small but important edit needed: The law doesn't protect certain groups from discrimination.  The law protects people  (i.e., all of us, depending on which law we're considering)  from being discriminated against on certain bases - race, gender, religion. So just as black people are protected against being discriminated against because they're black, so are white people protected against being discriminated against because they're white. Just because the former occurs in the U.S. more often than the latter doesn't mean ""certain groups""are being protected against discrimination.",0.8504
11,"The NAACP was founded by white people too ... The mission and purpose of the NAACP isn't to advance the well-being of black people (though that's a part of it). The mission and purpose of the NAACP is to work with other like-minded Americans toward fulfilling the promise of a living together in a more perfect Union. In any case, Americans (black and white) are too focused on race rather than on character. Where's MLK when we need him? You know, ""judge a person by their character and not by the color of their skin?""",0.8501

14,"Brought up with white privilege, she used this to her advantage to climb the employment ladder, sell her paintings, and speak out in the media.

15,"Well, not YOUNG, but at least solidly middle aged. The Founding Fathers were very sound in setting the minimum age at 35 (considering what 35 meant in 1789).<br/><br/>45 is about right on the younger side, assuming one has been a Governor or something other high level management job -- and 65 is about the MAXIMUM, because you are expected to serve EIGHT YEARS.

23,Your perspective is a bit narrow.  The entire concept of race is a nineteenth-century artifact of social sciences at that time. Most of us who consider ourselves of European descent have more in common genetically with those of African descent than those of other ethnic and racial groups.<br/>Why do you care how she chooses to identify herself?

25,"Black and black crime is a function of the gun lobby dumping upwards of 300  million guns into America's streets, redlining blacks and other minorities into ghettos for decades (centuries?) and sending blue collar jobs to China, Mexico and elsewhere thanks to free trade/trickle down economics. Those black and minority communities are filled with young, unemployed and anxious and stressed people with easy access to guns. Gee - what the heck do you think is going to happen? <br/><br/>And many whites simply say/think, ""those animals are just killing themselves - so be it.""<br/><br/>Those are not bugs of that system but features. <br/><br/>Conservative intellectual William Buckley once told Gore Vidal that inequality is the byproduct of ""freedom"" - he was correct, we are seeing that idea play out in America on a daily basis. <br/><br/>Are conservatives (including Dem conservatives) and the GOP prepared to roll back trickle down economics, return the tax code to sanity and stop the aggressive hollowing out of American's working and middle classes via free trade? <br/><br/>Because if not, then the answer to inequality is the free trade/trickle down economics mitigation plan - guns everywhere, segregated neighborhoods and schools for whites and an aggressive, racist police state for blacks and other minorities.",0.7041

29,"President Obama's relationship to Kenya is complex - how deep his connection to his Kenyan father went, how he also identified as the child of an American-born Caucasian mother - and it is precisely these levels of nuance that add to Obama's intelligence and insights as a leader.  Even in 2008, Obama made clear that his personal background gave him unique understandings about people and about life outside the US.  From a foreign policy based on assessments of a world that is complex and not managed by reductive thinking and one-size-fits-all policies, to his hold of racial relations, the complexities of President Obama's life have made him a standout.

39,"A number of years ago, I worked with a predominantly African-American school district.  Because of my position, I presented at the graduation of a middle school with 98% African-American children.  One of the things I began with was:  I look white, but we are all out of Africa—so I am Black.  The children knew me and the children cheered.<br/>I’m married to a Mexican-American man and have a Hispanic last name.  I have a little Native American ancestry from my mother’s side.  My father’s family was from Virginia and given the amount of black crossover, many of us (as reported in the Upshot section the NYT) carry traces of more recent African-American ancestry. I concluded that as a possibility, but it was nice to see it verified in the Times.<br/>I have never checked anything but white on college or job applications.<br/>But, we are indeed all Black and out of Africa.

This is important because we must all unite around injustice to truly eradicate it. As a white woman married to a black man and with 2 beautiful biracial daughters - I have had to bail my husband out of jail after he was harassed by TSA for acting like ""an angry black man"" and not following their commands fast enough.

As I was reading the article, the topic of racism brought up a question in my mind because even today, years after segregation was stated to be unlawful, racism is considered to be the hot topic of America and even around the world. For instance, from unequal treatment in school to lawful punishments in the court, there are numerous different cases that dealt with the topic of racism, and now, not only the topic is brought up frequently than ever in our society but also it has brought up more controversial arguments than any other time. This may have been due to our existence of Internet and other technology, but I can, for sure, say that racism will be the most frequently debated topics among the Americans even for many more centuries because America is a place where great diversity exist. On the other hand, another side topic that was brought up in the article was using claims about racism to one's benefit. Although the girls from the university might have felt ignored and attacked during the practices, it has been found that no signs of segregation during the practices and trips were shown. In brief, whether the girls used it to their advantage or not, the topic of racism still continues in our society.",-0.983

The one-sidedness, generalities and bias referenced with black AND white parities is not only redundant, it’s also inaccurate.<br/><br/>True, SOME police officers have made horrendous decisions which have cost lives – BLACK and WHITE I might add, but to write that black communities feel the same kind of terror of those people who survived the 9/11 attacks is incredulous.

This author is being racist towards white people in this article.

The FBI Uniform Crime Report (Expanded Homicide Data Table 6) shows that 409 blacks murdered whites while 189 whites (including Hispanics) murdered blacks in 2013.  Blacks make up only 13 percent of the population, but commit about 68 percent of interracial murders. Even when police homicides are factored in, blacks still kill more whites than whites kill blacks. Some of black homicide victims, of course, are killed by black police officers. A recent ProPublica study showed that most black police homicide victims are killed by white officers, “But in hundreds of instances, black officers, too. Black officers account for a little more than 10 percent of all fatal police shootings. Of those they kill, though, 78 percent were black.”",-0.9969
