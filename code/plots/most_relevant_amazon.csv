"Do you work 40 hours a week? Do you know when you'll be working? Are you well compensated for being on call or do you work for free when you tele-commute? Are you sent home without pay if it's slow or required to clock out but remain on the job site just in case there's an influx of customers? This article isn't about high tech industry or white collar workers being on call. Everyone knows that there are certain industries that require this. It is about places like Wal-Mart, McDonalds, Home Depot and other lower wage employers who schedule work hours so erratically that you don't know when you'll be working or even IF you'll be working any given week.<br/>Sorry, this article isn't about you!",0.956673029325405
"Being an engineer is fine, but engineering or STEM fields relegate you to worker-bee status with some perks. I left my second job in engineering around 3 years ago at 26 and went into consulting with app/big data/good business skills and it has landed me a lot of fortune 20 gigs presenting my work to c-level/vp level at these companies. I had the same situation: I told my current employer, pay me 55% more or I'm leaving. The best they could do is 15%. I walked out the next day.<br/><br/>And this is the job market for those with in-demand skills, just ask your price. Can you blame people in this position for abusing it? The thing is, most people in this position have honed their skills and put a lot of weekends of work in to get to the point which they are so much better than everyone else. I work 15-17 hour days, and while one might be off enjoying a Sunday soccer game with the kids, I'm most likely working.<br/><br/>The idea here is, go get yourself some skills which allow you to have an extreme amount of power over employers.",0.95639873031407
"I have a high tech job at a leading high tech F500 firm.  like most of our peer companies, our job performance is reviewed by our quality of work, not necessarily quantity.  I rarely work nights/weekends unless I'm meeting with colleagues in opposite time zones to find a compromise.  My stress level is very low, and my morale and motivation are excellent.  I've had more time to spend with my family and personal life than any other time in my 15 year career because I've learned to manage myself and my manager.<br/>With all the talent and skillsets the fresh-out-of-college workforce can bring to a company, it's softskills and personal skills (time management?) where they are severely lacking.  My counterpart who was hired one year before me worked nights/weekends and was a constant suck-up to mgmt and a real go-getter whose plate was far fuller than mine was.  This person was let go last year and those responsibilities were given to me.  I haven't had to work a single after hour to wrap up those projects.  A tip to the inexperienced: trust your team and respect everybody, don't be the smartest person in the room, delegate but share in success/failures, have your projects and deliverables under control and your boss will notice.  Let your work speak for you.",0.955191178566295
"I find it rather disingenuous that Bezos is not aware of this culture at his company.   My gut tells me that he knows exactly what is going on, but that he just doesn't see that there is anything wrong with it.    And those that are complaining are just whiners.   Since more and more companies are going in this direction and many are expected to work at least 50 hours a week, I think its time for the Department of Labor to step in and provide some protection the way that non-exempt employees have.    Too many companies are trying to skirt the law by making people ""managers"" or ""contractors"" so they can work them without having to provide compensation.    And they need to take into account the technology tether that most employers now just expect.   Already the wealth gap is exploding in favor of the 1% despite increases in productivity.     But that isn't enough apparently.<br/><br/>We need the DOL to come in and require employers to pay ALL employees and contract workers for the hours they work AND are required to be onsite, including time and a half and double time.   These companies may become a better place to work if they have to think twice about demanding that extra report or that whatever at 4:00 pm on a Friday.",0.954151121942419
"""1. In today's tech climate, some companies don't wish to pay their employees 150K or 120K for skills that can be outsourced for cost of 85-90K.

And it's getting worse every day. For an example, we did an assessment for a large printer company that had hundreds of Indian contractors from Wipro. The company software had an invoice engine that took 24 hours to deliver an invoice. Imagine that. 24 hours to deliver a single one page invoice. This had been developed by the folks from Wipro and by anecdotal accounts had worked like this for 2 years.  We went in, and in 6 weeks of work (2 people) redid the software, added a few custom enhancements and the thing not only delivered an invoice in a few seconds, it had added functionality. We bid on another project and the this large printer company decided to use Wipro. <br/><br/>Does this make sense to you? If it does you're a candidate for corporate management. ",0.953911281263714
"It's not just women that are affected by HR specifying last salary or rate. I was one of those victims. Like a good employee I worked hard. I was in manufacturing for almost 20 years. My pay fell farther and farther behind my peers. Finally, I was making $60k/year while I was worth $90k/year. A recruiter told me honestly that I could never expect to be paid what I was worth because HR departments wouldn't offer more than 5% above my last salary.<br/>I quit engineering for 2 years and worked as an editor. I'd get calls:""Don't you want to be in engineering?"" Not at $65k a year, I'd reply. I made that much as an editor and back in engineering, I'd be working 50-70 hours a week for less per hour than I made as an editor.<br/>Finally, a former colleague who recognized my value offered me a job at a fair rate. I've been a contract engineer ever since. I don't work full time but at least I get paid for my hours. I was treated as expendable anyway with these manufacturers. None of the engineers I surveyed for the magazine ever wanted to go back into production.<br/>I think it is criminal to restrict pay by allowing HR access to information on your last position.

"I was thrilled when I was hired as a manager by Amazon.  I lasted about 6 months.  I was working 6 -7 days a week, 12 -14 hours a day and getting called frequently when ""off duty"" when I finally quit.  The joke that I often heard during my tenure with Amazon was ""Work life balance is for those who don't like work.""  That pretty much sums up Amazon's culture.  Most of the other managers I knew were either waiting to complete their first year so that they could quit without having to pay back their signing bonus, or they were waiting for their latest stock award to vest so they could quit.  It seemed like most everybody was counting down toward a quitting date.  The NYT article is spot on regarding the pressures put on the white collar/managerial workers at Amazon.  The Times should do a follow-on article focusing on the plight of the poor hourly workers toiling in Amazon's fulfillment centers in sweat-shop-like conditions for paltry wages so folks can get their dog food, toilet paper, and other ""stuff"" delivered to their door steps.  The pressure put on those folks is intense, especially during ""Peak Season.""  I don't think Amazon's current work force model can be sustained.  At some point I think enough people, both customers and potential employees, are going to realize how immoral and exploitative Amazon's culture is.  Hopefully Amazon will not have run all of the mom and pop and brick and mortar retailers out of business before then.  ",0.953193030762709
"I am a software consultant, working around different companies that have large Tech teams. These days, most of them have 'Temporary' consultants.

"If you think its hard to start a business, try being an employee on the bottom rung of the economic ladder.  The issue here is corporations are using cut-out contracting firms to limit wage growth.  By adding a middle layer, the cut-out limits the corporations responsibilities and gives it plausible deniability.  The NRLB is simply stating that the corporations can't hide behind a contracting firm if the corporation is dictating how the business is run.  You say its hard to start a company, but try negotiating your employment contact when there are several levels of indirection between you and the company calling the shots.  Without a union to back you up, its a take it or leave it contract.  And if you think that's fair, well don't complain about the government giving you hard time.

I have a high-paying salaried job and I often work over 40 hours and am not compensated for that, but I don't mind because I am compensated well and I'm still paid if I miss a day. Imagine if you were a manager of a McDonald's and were salaried at $36,000 per year, but expected to work 60-70 hours per week.

"I'm not against internships (it helps to have something even marginally relevant on your brand-new resume), but they've become another way of devaluing work. <br/><br/>I've seen an unconscionable number of ads these days requiring large amounts of skill for abysmal pay. One I saw yesterday insisted that applicants have Smartphones with GPS, at a rate of pay that would not support a Smartphone. I constantly see ads for writing jobs that want to own all rights but offer little or even NO upfront pay. I even saw one that wanted a someone who could both write a biography and work as a shepherd, building fences and so on! (No, I am not kidding.)<br/><br/>People horribly devalue work and even skills these days. It seems that half our population think they're budding plutocrats whom others should be happy to work for in exchange for ""exposure"" or a starvation wage. I know too many people who are doing the same jobs for less money, simply because it's become the rule. It's got to stop, or we will have no middle class. Work deserves pay; skilled work deserves decent pay. And those hiring should get off their high horses and stop thinking they're doing people a favor by exploiting them. <br/><br/>As someone else said, if you can't pay your workers an appropriate wage, you don't have a viable business. It's nothing to be proud of. Neither is asking people with extensive skills to use them in your service for $10-12 an hour—or nothing at all.",0.949752871523555
"People who are shocked by this article, you need to understand that Amazon is not the only place like this. I worked in a start-up that was similar and I know friends in law, consulting, tech, accounting, you name it, that are working 10-12 hour days 7 days a week. Sometimes they don't even get full-time employee contracts, just temporary X month long gigs. The 9-5 is quickly going the way of the dodo.<br/>People who say that employees are free to leave whenever they want to, you're right. But it's not like these guys are going to leave for better balanced jobs. Like  I said, there are TONS of jobs out there that are similar, maybe even the only available option in their fields. And if ex-Amazon employees are truly addicted to the work culture, they're going to bring it with them, helping to erase work-life balance for the rest of us.<br/>Lastly, people who say that this kind of work culture is a good thing for Amazon or the employers like it, are you absolutely sure that the benefits are worth the costs? This has got to cost Amazon a ton of money in constant recruiting, employee buyouts, and on boarding.  Or just the general inefficiency caused by employees having to rework strategies because their coworkers disappear or are burned out. Maybe, just maybe, people could work less and still have the same output if they could learn to work as a real team.",0.948944179617457
"I've been an executive where I've worked a min of 60 hrs a week + travel and loved most moments of it.   <br/><br/>But when it becomes part of corporate culture (except perhaps in an understaffed startup), the hours themselves become an objective instead of achieving quality.<br/><br/>Employees should be judged by their efficiency &amp; the quality of their ideas and work, not by whether their car is still in the parking lot.  I have seen tech companies where the employees do little during normal business hours and then perform the company's actual work after 5pm.<br/><br/>I have no problem with a company filtering out the worst employees.  In any company, there are employees who don't bring value.   But Amazon seems to have developed a corporate culture where demeaning employees is seen as a strategy to develop strong leaders and that is most certainly not the same thing as challenging employees to do their best.  Demeaning people is about ego replacing strategy. <br/><br/>In the environment described in the NYT, one would think that Amazon is changing every day.   But I don't see the user experience or the product mix changing often.  So outside of operations, I really have to wonder what it is that these highly pressured employees are actually doing every day that makes such demands on their time, since so much of Amazon's site is automated. <br/><br/>If one doesn't spend time with real people, they'll have no understanding of their needs and won't be able to create a quality and valuable experience for them.",0.947973115142363
"I do not know what it is like to work at Amazon on a full-time basis, but I did work there as a part-time senior workamper at age 76. For three months I worked at a huge warehouse in Fernley, NV, seven football fields long, scanning and counting all kinds of products in thousands of bins for approximately ten hours a day, so that the staff  knew up to the minute where everything was located. My wife worked in a different department, breaking-down boxes of items into smaller packages for easy shipping.   <br/><br/>To be honest...I loved the job, the work environment, and the opportunity to participate in a unique work-space for about 400 seniors, and interact with a large group of employees, that numbered into the thousands.  My department had two well trained managers who previewed our work each day at 6:00 AM sharp, and then again at 1:00 PM.  <br/><br/>What I experienced was an opportunity to work when other employers looked askance at those of us over 70 years old.  Many of the best workers were the immigrants who left me in the dust despite my three advanced degrees.  This was a pathway for many to participate in the American Dream.  Together, my wife and I earned over $14,000 for our three months there, enough to continue our nomadic way of life for another year.  So...we can look at Amazon through different lenses with different views and impressions.  For me, I have high praise for the company.  And, it has the best customer relations in the USA...period.",0.945440986095192
"I have no problem with a company ASKING employees to work long hours, however, the workers should be compensated for every hour of work. As a highly educated worker, if you're being salaried for a 40-hour job, then being forced to work 85, you are probably being compensated at somewhere around minimum wage. Amazon workers should do the math on that and they'd probably be shocked at what they pull in on an hourly rate.    ",0.945089823506235
"I am a former employee in Amazon's legal department.  Prior to working there I spent 5 years on Wall Street working for a top law firm - a demanding and challenging workplace by any measure.  But even that didn't prepare me for the workplace hell of Amazon's corporate offices.<br/><br/>From day one at Amazon the workflow is overwhelming and employees are constantly undermined by a culture of vicious backstabbing.  The designed attrition is real and celebrated, with longer term employees seeing themselves as sitting atop a Darwinian pyramid that chews up and spits out those less willing to sacrifice all other aspects of their lives advancing the Amazon principles.  They view their job not so much as trying to help new employees succeed, but as the second phase of a weeding out (the first phase being the hiring process). I'd say that less than half of the lawyers they hire last more than a year there, and virtually all begin planning their exit strategy within months of arrival.<br/><br/>I'd say morale is low if I didn't think that overstated just how unhappy employees are.  As an example, a colleague who was 8+ months pregnant talked flatly about how much she looked forward to the birth of her first child because she could then take two weeks off for maternity leave.<br/><br/>As for myself, after a few months at Amazon, going back to working late nights, weekends and holidays for Wall Street clients seemed like not such a bad gig by comparison, and my former firm readily welcomed me back.",0.942388079462234

The stress is high and there used to be a lot of overtime.<br/>I valued that employee who took another service call at 3:00 knowing it might keep him past five. He may not have been the most technically qualified person but he was dependable. During the 1990 recession I kept all my employees on though there wasn't enough work. I went without pay for a year to do it.  As things improved one employee who had stayed 1/2 hour past five o'clock charged me for the overtime. The fact that he'd had months of pay without working full days didn't come to mind. Fair play was expected on my part but not on his.<br/>I'd kept him on because he could do good work although his coworkers and some customers disliked him because of his bigotry toward those who didn't meet his standard of Christian practice including myself.<br/>At long last he aggravated me enough to be terminated cleanly without running afoul of the Dep't of Labor.<br/>I pay according to your worth to me and my company. You can be the greatest technician in the world and still be worth less than the person who just comes to work dependably and doesn't create problems. That's why I hated being in a forced union job.

"But what is really left out of these stories is how hard many of us do work, how often we do put in overtime, not because we want to but because we must.  And our employers expect it, even if that overtime has an adverse impact on our lives.  Overtime is never questioned in America.  What is questioned is leaving on time, having a personal life outside of work, having medical needs that must be dealt with during the workday.

Ask any person who has worked in corporate America and the stories that can be told are hair raising.  <br/><br/>At one place I worked a researcher threw a pregnant woman into the wall.

Nothing was done in spite of complaints.  I made an appointment one month in advance to see an optometrist, let everyone know, and that day, one hour before I had to go, my supervisor called me to tell me I should have told him.

I worked for an IT outsourcing firm that also pushed for long hours, but only for exempt employees. Non-exempt staff got to go home on time. Clients were billed for the extra hours but none of the money went to the employee. Our environment wasn't nearly as toxic as Amazon's but we certainly knew better than to complain to the HR department. The NYT story could be dismissed, if it were an isolated story but 60 Minutes also ran a story about the abysmal warehouse working conditions for Amazon employees. And you have hundreds of stories from former Amazon employees flying around the internet about how horrible it is to work there. My advice to Amazon employees is to put up with it as long as you can but leave on your own terms when it is to your advantage. Right now there are a ton of good jobs in the IT field.

"Article: “Can a Hotel Robot Read a ‘Do Not Disturb’ Sign?”<br/>By ELAINE GLUSAC<br/>The world of technology is advancing more and more every day. Now some hotels and cruise ships have robots doing people’s work for them. If robots can start working for us then what kind of jobs are there going to be left for humans to do. The robot even has feelings to show if it’s happy by making R2D2 noises. If we have robots doing deliveries, check-ins, providing entertainment, and even being a bartender, then where are the people working at. If you were to think about this carefully, you might ask yourself, “Is this even a good idea?” <br/><br/>This may seem like a cool invention, but will we end up thinking this is bad and regret what we have done. Some people might think having robots work might be better because you can program the robot to be nice unlike some people working. For now we leave the easy jobs to the robots and more complex task to humans, but if we can program robots to do one thing then I think robots in the future will be able to do the more complex task.

At Microsoft I frequently went home at 5 and was called out by my supervisor, even though I came to work early. And I often didn't see greater productivity on the part of those who worked long hours - just more hallway chit-chat and game playing.

"In the shift to making shareholders the top priority, the workforce is seen to be a liability, merely a cost to be minimized.  Rather than invest in the workforce, businesses do their best to wring every last dollar from them.  At the higher levels, this comes with certain ""perks"": on-campus cafeterias, daycare centers, fitness centers, dry cleaning services, etc.  Touted as conveniences for the employees, they also coincidentally, reduce the number of reasons they can present for leaving the work site at a decent time.  At the same time, employers don't tell them that they have to work longer hours, they just add to the list of responsibilities, reduce the number of employees who need to accomplish the work.  It's the classic case of offering a promotion without a raise.  At the less prestigious end of the spectrum, we see split shifts, on-call conditions of employment, varying work schedules, greater employment of contingent workers, heavier leaning on temp agencies.

"I worked for Amazon for over 5 years. It's true, Amazon is hard place to work and it's not for everyone. But it's not really accurate to characterize this as mistreatment because, in my opinion, a lot of the stresses are self-inflicted.<br/><br/>Amazon hires smart and driven people -- a lot of type-A personalities who are used to succeeding and will push themselves to succeed. The company, run by the same types of people, has put in place a culture and hiring system that attracts more of the same. As a result, people push themselves and others very hard.<br/><br/>This is not slave labor. Amazon employees are all at-will employees, they can leave at any time, and they are compensated well. In fact, as mentioned in the article, working at Amazon often makes you attractive to other employers, so it's not like employees can't find work elsewhere. So why do people stay? Because they are the types of people that want to win and want to achieve.<br/><br/>After leaving Amazon I went to work at a small company. I work harder now than I did at Amazon. It turns out it wasn't entirely Amazon that was crazy, it was mostly me.",0.937298816318065
"I am a recruiter for the warehousing industry.  I turned down a position at Amazon based on the management I interviewed with.  I saw a lot of ethical dilemmas and ultimately decided to withdraw my candidacy.   One of the problems, especially with day laborers in the warehouse is the avoidance of offering healthcare.  To comply with the ACA, the production scheduling is keeping employees at under 30 hours, or rotating staff every 2-3 months as ""temporary"" hires, laying them off for 6 months with an eligibility for rehire.<br/><br/>I have had people who were layed off from Amazon who had letters of recommendation supporting good production and good attendance.  Why would you eliminate those people in the warehousing industry.  <br/><br/>Warehousing typically has high rollover and many hires have attendance issues.  This is a given which is why I think Amazon can avoid the scrutiny.  <br/><br/>What I can't figure out is that when Amazon had a ""job fair"", they hired people on the spot so long as they had their high school diploma with them and was told the starting salary was $6.53 an hour, well under the NJ State minimum of $8.38.  I am not sure how they managed that but it is just another thing on the long list of the poor conditions.",0.936512028464301

If this is the wave of the future, then I suggest that young people become entrepreneurs, i.e., the old maxim about working twice as hard when you have your own business versus working for someone else is not true in the case of working for Amazon.

If they can last three years, they will only get a two dollar raise (12.xx to 14.xx).<br/><br/>The white collar workers do spend a week working in the warehouse in their Amazon Experience Week (AEW). This is insulting to the regular workers because the AEWs are only there for a short time and are not subject to performance reviews. How would you feel if you were doing your job for months or years and you see people who are making three or more times your salary who are basically there for a show and tell session? The AEWs also barely talk to the warehouse workers during their time there because most of them consider themselves above regular workers.<br/><br/>Amazon is borderline exploiting its FC associates. Amazon corporate employees should have to work in an FC for a month and be subject to evaluations. And they should have to work at an FC for a week every year.

"I haven't been in the job market for a long time.  I found out in my early fifties that age discrimination was real.  I live close to a university and so I did a lot of looking there.  And here's one thing I remember from that.  The ads for 'executive assistant' (and there were a lot) described a multitude of tasks to be done and skills needed to do them.  Computer chops had to be top notch, with candidates needing familiarity from day one with different systems, etc.  But you know how much they were going to pay someone to be a super duper secretary?  About $7.50 an hour.  (This was about ten years ago).  I would just look at the long list of tasks in the description and then look at the pay and wonder how in the world they could only pay $7.50 an hour.  But, of course, they never had any problem finding qualified people to take the jobs and wanting the jobs even with that low of pay.  It always seemed like a huge disconnect to me.  'We want you to do all of this, and at a very high skill and without us training you, and then we will pay you a pittance'.  See how it works, Mr. Friedman?

"Amazon has a well-known reputation for its difficult workplace environment and most employees should have walked in with their eyes open. Did Amazon promise them something different during their interviews? All these employees have a choice and this is not the same as the exploitation of nail-workers in the city or of workers in China. Most of them do not have alternatives. Amazon has every right to create a work model and to weed out any employee that does not fit their model. This is no different from working 100 hours a week at Goldman Sachs or long hours and nights in the early years of a medical career. The Army will put new recruits through an intensive physical regimen and expect them to meet those standards. Rightly or wrongly, those organizations believe that theirs is the best ""model"" and will weed out anyone who cannot conform to their model.

When most people were being paid by the hour and bosses had to pay overtime, they'd hire efficiency experts and work hard to streamline their business process. Indeed, the work week for hourly workers keeps falling year by year, but salaried workers hours have increased. When work costs money, businesses will become more efficient.
