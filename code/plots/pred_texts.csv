0,"I had the pleasure of seeing Hamilton during its run at the Public.  I can see how you might get the impression that it is ""pedestrian"" from the clips, but this show is greater than the sum of its parts.  Noise/Funk was a great show, but it was a dance concert.  I think Hamilton compares favorably to Rent, and I think it will have a similar impact (if not as many ticket sales)."
1,"""Victoria"", the factors you cite represent the realities that every defense lawyer knows: it depends on which judge you draw as to how severe or mild a punishment might be. It's a crap shoot, a roll of the dice. The sentence could depend on how the judge feels that day. (Lack of sleep? Bad vibes at home? Ten years for you!)<br/><br/>I am not a lawyer, but I have enough experience watching the courts, etc., to say this to anyone who is accused of a crime, any crime no matter how minor: think 300 times before pleading guilty to anything. Once someone has done that, their rights of appeal are virtually wiped away and they are placed at the ""mercy"" of whatever the judge wants to do with them.<br/><br/>It is also obvious that someone convicted of any sex offense, or even a related offense, faces a virtual life sentence. This should merit maximum effort on all fronts to avoid conviction. Unfortunately, people who don't have a lot of money, or can't get some, can't afford a maximum effort on defense."
2,"Obviously the system fattens up favored candidates financially to keep up with the lobbyist lifestyle under the constraints of public salaries. For instance, one knows one is becoming important when a famous publishing company offers one a fat advance to write about the dreams of one's father."
3,"Hypatia,<br/><br/>When I speak of ""the majority of the worlds Muslims"", I do so from an experience with, and knowledge of, both Islam and Muslim societies. I may be just a Jarhead and war veteran, but my travels have taken me over two different continents, one theater of war, and numerous encounters with cultures who, in your words, ""emulate the Prophet"".  Your patronizing comments notwithstanding,  I still have faith that the average human can transcend prejudice and gain an ability to view ISIS and their ilk as not representative of Muslims, but rather the inevitable outgrowth of a brutal  Salafist ideology whose victims have also included other Muslims. I wonder how the pious and devout Sunni Kurds I encountered, and withstood ISIS's onslaught, would regard your view? Or the devout Muslim family of American soldier Kareem Khan, killed while deployed in Iraq, and now buried at Arlington National Cemetery? Or the scores of Muslims weeping at the site of Jordanian fighter pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh being burned alive by ISIS swine?  I've travelled too far, and encountered too many civilized people, for me to succumb to the laziness of Islamophobia.  We are in a global war.  People who've never experienced it ought to try and process the fact that many of its casualties are also devout Muslims.  Too many good people have been slaughtered. They deserve better than your comments.  If you won't fight or pray for the weak, then at least honor them."
4,Hillary is only 2 years younger than Sanders. 
5,"Mr. Beard's comment is an apt summary of one of the arguments in support of the deal - why not take a chance on the Iranian people being friendlier to the US in 15 years, accepting the error of their ways, and realizing the foolishness of precipitating a nuclear arms race in the Middle East? Indeed, why not? It is a charming example of our hopeful American naivete in dealing with the Iranians. Since 1979 the Iranian leadership has been consistent in its aims - to become the ultimate guardians of Shiism through superior force of arms. Getting nukes is not an option - it is a must for them. As for the dream - and it is only that - of having Iran become an American-loving ally within 15 years, history portends otherwise. Americans want, expect and measure social and political change by increments of months and years. Iranians (Persians) measure their history by millennia. And don't think that the Western-loving, mostly secular intelligentsia of Tehran is the future of Iran. This is a country that has and will continue to be defined by a majority of Iranians who live outside the Tehran metro area, and who are devout Shias supporting or at least accepting of the legitimacy of the Iranian theocracy. Betting on change in 15 years as basis for supporting this deal is like wishing on a star. It is just as intellectually dishonest as the speculative fear mongering you decry. "
6,"A Brilliant, Thoughtful and Charity (Love) Filled reflection and narrative on the tragedy occurring in Africa and Europe.<br/><br/>Mr. Douthat has called attention to a humanitarian crisis that the Obama Administration has turned a ""cold shoulder"" to. <br/><br/>China, which is profiting daily in a massive way from Africa is completely unwilling to help either.<br/><br/>Thank You Mr. Douthat for having the courage and love to bring attention to the horrible suffering and death being endured by Africans."
7,The horses that run the Triple Crown races are three-years old. That is equivalent to a 17 year old human. At four they are more fully developed and can compare to young man of 20.  That three-year human stretch between 17 and 20 makes a huge difference in the maturity of the horse.
8,"More and more people support marriage equality, but we are seeing legislative pushback in the form of ""religious freedom"" laws like the one just passed in North Carolina. If we leave it to bigoted anti-gay politicians to pass laws legalizing same-sex marriage, then some states will never have marriage equality. Much of the American South would still have slavery, or at least Jim Crow laws, if we left racial equality to their state legislatures. Anti-gay bigotry and anti-gay discrimination that is codified into law must be stopped by any means available. Only someone who approves of discrimination against gay people (for whatever reason) would carp about the way that equality is achieved."
9,And why would Algeria or Morocco want them or be responsible for resolving this difficult issue?
10,"This is a complex issue, but its' seeds are in years, no decades, of racial profiling known as red lining. For those who want to delve into this subject I recommend a book: Crabgrass Frontier. For the knownothings, just count your blessings that you didn't end up in these neighborhoods due to the luck of the draw."
11,"Technically, the clause you refer to only establishes how many representatives shall be given to each state. It does not say how the representatives shall be apportioned within each state, nor does it say anything about representation in the state government."
12,"Unfortunately there are 1000 mm in a meter, so 3 meters would be 3000 mm/50 years = 60mm/year."
13,Painting black rooftops white to reflect heat instead of absorbing it is useful in hot climates where it would have a/c electricity bills. When it's cold outside you want the rooftop to be black to absorb heat and cut down on heating bills.
14,"Well, it's even surprising that it took until 1803 for that to be established. The necessity of a deliberate body to review laws would have come about in any case as it's very apparent that a congress and states could enact laws that would (and did, often) impinge on the rights of citizens. How else would you have protections against legislative whims? It is a part of the checks and balances that effectively gets the country further towards the perfect union. Two steps forward, one step back. And the bad decisions get eventually fixed. On the whole, however, I think most everyone would agree that the US is a more equitable nation now than it was in 1787."
15,"LOL, no wonder! I thought, what do I architects have to do with this? "
16,hmmm ..... are you aware of the TSH level in Michael Brown's blood? It was waaaaay higher than the level that impacts judgement (2.5 times higher). You should read the Grand Jury testimony &amp; the forensic reports.  
17,"And Krugman has been decrying the insanity of not exploiting low interest rates to invest in hospitals/schools/...  Still, is it so incredibly black and white as you pose the problem.  Taking out debt to cover salaries, pensions, benefits, etc. does have a positive effect.  It keeps money out there and bolsters demand.  It can help a country endure a slump.  I assume that you would put unemployment insurance in the same no productive return bin.  If Greece's problem was just that it was temporarily borrowing to offset a slump, that would not have been bad debt.  It would have been prudent.  That was not Greece's problem.  They couldn't service the debt that they had no matter how that debt had been generated and the austerity conditions that were imposed completely collapsed the economy.  You can lose respect for Mr. Krugman if you wish.  I don't think that your argument actually supports that though."
18,"This will be a day, June 26, 2015, that many of us, gay or straight, will remember for years to come. this is a ruling about equal protection under the law, a central principle in the 14th amendment. "
19,"The damage to the bodies and brains of these people is mentioned, but not one word about the damage to their souls.  Killing is not a profession, it is often a sin of terrible consequences. The soldier lives with all of that forever.  It is why the idea of Shell Shock, Battle Fatigue, Operational Exhaustion and more has morphed into today's PTSD.  God did not create us to be killers, that is a role we humans chose for ourselves. The U.S. Military views its combat operators as they do a Jeep, or a Truck, something to use up, and replace when destroyed.  The VA debacles of the last 20 years have only demonstrated the truth of what I just said.  May God have Mercy on these poor souls. "
