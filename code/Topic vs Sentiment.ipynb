      "6 : I find it rather disingenuous that Bezos is not aware of this culture at his company.   My gut tells me that he knows exactly what is going on, but that he just doesn't see that there is anything wrong with it.    And those that are complaining are just whiners.   Since more and more companies are going in this direction and many are expected to work at least 50 hours a week, I think its time for the Department of Labor to step in and provide some protection the way that non-exempt employees have.    Too many companies are trying to skirt the law by making people \"managers\" or \"contractors\" so they can work them without having to provide compensation.    And they need to take into account the technology tether that most employers now just expect.   Already the wealth gap is exploding in favor of the 1% despite increases in productivity.     But that isn't enough apparently.<br/><br/>We need the DOL to come in and require employers to pay ALL employees and contract workers for the hours they work AND are required to be onsite, including time and a half and double time.   These companies may become a better place to work if they have to think twice about demanding that extra report or that whatever at 4:00 pm on a Friday. 0.9541511219424188\n",

And it's getting worse every day. For an example, we did an assessment for a large printer company that had hundreds of Indian contractors from Wipro. The company software had an invoice engine that took 24 hours to deliver an invoice. Imagine that. 24 hours to deliver a single one page invoice. This had been developed by the folks from Wipro and by anecdotal accounts had worked like this for 2 years.  We went in, and in 6 weeks of work (2 people) redid the software, added a few custom enhancements and the thing not only delivered an invoice in a few seconds, it had added functionality. We bid on another project and the this large printer company decided to use Wipro. <br/><br/>Does this make sense to you?

      "8 : It's not just women that are affected by HR specifying last salary or rate. I was one of those victims. Like a good employee I worked hard. I was in manufacturing for almost 20 years. My pay fell farther and farther behind my peers. Finally, I was making $60k/year while I was worth $90k/year. A recruiter told me honestly that I could never expect to be paid what I was worth because HR departments wouldn't offer more than 5% above my last salary.<br/>I quit engineering for 2 years and worked as an editor. I'd get calls:\"Don't you want to be in engineering?\" Not at $65k a year, I'd reply. I made that much as an editor and back in engineering, I'd be working 50-70 hours a week for less per hour than I made as an editor.<br/>Finally, a former colleague who recognized my value offered me a job at a fair rate. I've been a contract engineer ever since. I don't work full time but at least I get paid for my hours. I was treated as expendable anyway with these manufacturers. None of the engineers I surveyed for the magazine ever wanted to go back into production.<br/>I think it is criminal to restrict pay by allowing HR access to information on your last position.

      "9 : I was thrilled when I was hired as a manager by Amazon.  I lasted about 6 months.  I was working 6 -7 days a week, 12 -14 hours a day and getting called frequently when \"off duty\" when I finally quit.

But it's not like these guys are going to leave for better balanced jobs. Like  I said, there are TONS of jobs out there that are similar, maybe even the only available option in their fields. And if ex-Amazon employees are truly addicted to the work culture, they're going to bring it with them, helping to erase work-life balance for the rest of us.<br/>Lastly, people who say that this kind of work culture is a good thing for Amazon or the employers like it, are you absolutely sure that the benefits are worth the costs? This has got to cost Amazon a ton of money in constant recruiting, employee buyouts, and on boarding.  Or just the general inefficiency caused by employees having to rework strategies because their coworkers disappear or are burned out. Maybe, just maybe, people could work less and still have the same output if they could learn to work as a real team. 0.9489441796174574\n",

The stress is high and there used to be a lot of overtime.<br/>I valued that employee who took another service call at 3:00 knowing it might keep him past five. He may not have been the most technically qualified person but he was dependable. During the 1990 recession I kept all my employees on though there wasn't enough work. I went without pay for a year to do it.  As things improved one employee who had stayed 1/2 hour past five o'clock charged me for the overtime. The fact that he'd had months of pay without working full days didn't come to mind. Fair play was expected on my part but not on his.<br/>I'd kept him on because he could do good work although his coworkers and some customers disliked him because of his bigotry toward those who didn't meet his standard of Christian practice including myself.<br/>At long last he aggravated me enough to be terminated cleanly without running afoul of the Dep't of Labor.<br/>I pay according to your worth to me and my company. You can be the greatest technician in the world and still be worth less than the person who just comes to work dependably and doesn't create problems. That's why I hated being in a forced union job.

What is questioned is leaving on time, having a personal life outside of work, having medical needs that must be dealt with during the workday.  We have a culture that claims to value employees, says that employees are the most important thing in a company, that employees should be treated as valuable assets.  Ask any person who has worked in corporate America and the stories that can be told are hair raising.  <br/><br/>At one place I worked a researcher threw a pregnant woman into the wall.  She left the job, he was never reprimanded or fired for such mistreatment.  At another place, one person was allowed to play his music at a volume high enough to deafen us.

I worked for an IT outsourcing firm that also pushed for long hours, but only for exempt employees. Non-exempt staff got to go home on time. Clients were billed for the extra hours but none of the money went to the employee. Our environment wasn't nearly as toxic as Amazon's but we certainly knew better than to complain to the HR department. The NYT story could be dismissed, if it were an isolated story but 60 Minutes also ran a story about the abysmal warehouse working conditions for Amazon employees. And you have hundreds of stories from former Amazon employees flying around the internet about how horrible it is to work there.

      "44 : One way we can have more family friendly workplaces, with an added benefit of cutting both unemployment and underemployment is for businesses to hire more people. There was a time when people could go home on time because there were enough workers to get all the work done in the 40 hours per week that's our standard shift requirement. <br/><br/>But then companies started laying off hundreds and thousands of people, expecting the people who didn't get laid off to add to their workload without complaining because, \"After all, they still had jobs.\" Over time, hiring the least number of people and expecting them to work all the time became the \"way business is done\".  Many of today's workers have no idea what it's like to work in a well-staffed workplace. So they accept the workplace this article talks about.<br/><br/>If businesses would hire back to the level where they didn't need their workers to stay late and work after they go home, society would be better off in many ways. People would be able to take care of their families. There would be enough people to cover if you have to leave for an emergency, thus there would be less resentment. The economy would get a huge boost because more people would have more money to spend. It's a win-win, unless you're an executive who fears having to take a pay cut or have less profit for the shareholders because you have to pay for all those extra employees.

      "45 : Article: “Can a Hotel Robot Read a ‘Do Not Disturb’ Sign?”<br/>By ELAINE GLUSAC<br/>The world of technology is advancing more and more every day. Now some hotels and cruise ships have robots doing people’s work for them. If robots can start working for us then what kind of jobs are there going to be left for humans to do. The robot even has feelings to show if it’s happy by making R2D2 noises. If we have robots doing deliveries, check-ins, providing entertainment, and even being a bartender, then where are the people working at. If you were to think about this carefully, you might ask yourself, “Is this even a good idea?” <br/><br/>This may seem like a cool invention, but will we end up thinking this is bad and regret what we have done. Some people might think having robots work might be better because you can program the robot to be nice unlike some people working. For now we leave the easy jobs to the robots and more complex task to humans, but if we can program robots to do one thing then I think robots in the future will be able to do the more complex task. I think we should stop being lazy and be responsible for our own jobs not just letting machines do the work for us because you will never know what might go wrong. 0.9388332710610782\n",

This article was an eye opener and it would certainly affect the decisions of some of the people from here in the east coast considering employment at Amazon.

      "50 : I'm a Seattle software company worker and it's not just Amazon - almost all software companies have a culture of competitiveness and working long hours. Working huge amounts of overtime is like a badge of honor and people brag about how much they work. A lot of it's unnecessary and the longer you work, the greater the diminishing marginal returns on your effort. At Microsoft I frequently went home at 5 and was called out by my supervisor, even though I came to work early. And I often didn't see greater productivity on the part of those who worked long hours - just more hallway chit-chat and game playing. I think with reasonable production schedules based on the amount of work rather than arbitrary deadlines and reasonable amounts of overtime (usually more overtime is required the closer you get to the ship date), software companies could do just fine and people could have lives in addition to jobs.

      "52 : In the shift to making shareholders the top priority, the workforce is seen to be a liability, merely a cost to be minimized.  Rather than invest in the workforce, businesses do their best to wring every last dollar from them.  At the higher levels, this comes with certain \"perks\": on-campus cafeterias, daycare centers, fitness centers, dry cleaning services, etc.  Touted as conveniences for the employees, they also coincidentally, reduce the number of reasons they can present for leaving the work site at a decent time.  At the same time, employers don't tell them that they have to work longer hours, they just add to the list of responsibilities, reduce the number of employees who need to accomplish the work.  It's the classic case of offering a promotion without a raise.  At the less prestigious end of the spectrum, we see split shifts, on-call conditions of employment, varying work schedules, greater employment of contingent workers, heavier leaning on temp agencies.  Presented under the guise of \"doing more with less,\" \"working together to get through difficult times,\" \"remaining competitive in a global market,\" it is all designed to maximize profits at the top.  The question never asked of business leaders is: How much money is enough?  When will you have enough profits in your pocket to treat your employees with the same regard that you treat yourself? 0.9373760842530867\n",
      "53 : I worked for Amazon for over 5 years. It's true, Amazon is hard place to work and it's not for everyone. But it's not really accurate to characterize this as mistreatment because, in my opinion, a lot of the stresses are self-inflicted.<br/><br/>Amazon hires smart and driven people -- a lot of type-A personalities who are used to succeeding and will push themselves to succeed. The company, run by the same types of people, has put in place a culture and hiring system that attracts more of the same. As a result, people push themselves and others very hard.<br/><br/>This is not slave labor. Amazon employees are all at-will employees, they can leave at any time, and they are compensated well. In fact, as mentioned in the article, working at Amazon often makes you attractive to other employers, so it's not like employees can't find work elsewhere. So why do people stay? Because they are the types of people that want to win and want to achieve.<br/><br/>After leaving Amazon I went to work at a small company. I work harder now than I did at Amazon.

      "54 : I've worked in lots of different environments.  In my 60s now I think that if motivation to do quality work doesn't come from within, then no amount of external pressure, either good or bad will make a difference.  And most importantly, unless you're talking about manual labor, quantity of hours does not equal quality of work.  The employee that hired someone unofficially to complete some of her data entry work had it right.  You need to delegate work to others to get the work done while achieving balance in you're own life.  That Amazon expects all this extra work from employees without compensation is just exploitive.  Plus it sounds like workers waste a lot of work hours backstabbing others instead of doing productive work, and are even encouraged to do so.  The key is to work smarter, not harder.  Amazon may have fooled investors and their own employees but eventually it will haunt them. 0.9367671690994565\n",

I saw a lot of ethical dilemmas and ultimately decided to withdraw my candidacy.   One of the problems, especially with day laborers in the warehouse is the avoidance of offering healthcare.  To comply with the ACA, the production scheduling is keeping employees at under 30 hours, or rotating staff every 2-3 months as \"temporary\" hires, laying them off for 6 months with an eligibility for rehire.<br/><br/>I have had people who were layed off from Amazon who had letters of recommendation supporting good production and good attendance.  Why would you eliminate those people in the warehousing industry.  <br/><br/>Warehousing typically has high rollover and many hires have attendance issues.

These folks fell into that trap.  The worth of your tech should not be based on the business running smoothly.  It runs smoothly because of these employees.  Rather the worth should be based on the cost when the tech fails and the business does not run smoothly.<br/><br/>Seems Disney will have an opportunity to examine that cost shortly.<br/><br/>And the number of people displaced by H1B's should alarm people.  The displacement of USA work to overseas for \"as good or better\" has been going on for decades as a method to decrease costs in the short term and ignore infrastructure in the long term.  <br/><br/>I myself was in a meeting where a C-level exec stated he wanted to reduce USA tech workforce from 15% to 5% and in the same meeting lamented the lack of tech workers coming from USA colleges.

Did Amazon promise them something different during their interviews? All these employees have a choice and this is not the same as the exploitation of nail-workers in the city or of workers in China. Most of them do not have alternatives. Amazon has every right to create a work model and to weed out any employee that does not fit their model. This is no different from working 100 hours a week at Goldman Sachs or long hours and nights in the early years of a medical career.

I, for one, do not believe anyone working 40  hours a week should be living in abject poverty while those at the upper echelons of that same company earn millions upon millions. 0.9304242616852503\n",
      "81 : I can understand the appeal of coming out of university and working at a company that demands the very best - and requires you  to work at the edge of what's possible (eg 60-70hr work weeks).   5 years ago these same people would have been working for Goldman Sachs. If the work is interesting, the compensation 'appropriate' then who am I to judge.  What some might consider a toxic work environment, others would consider the price for innovation.   <br/><br/>The real danger is the trickle down effect.  Its one thing to ask this from a Harvard grad looking to land a top job and work for 4-5 grueling years before heading off to an MBA.  Its quite another to carry these same demands down to mid level managers or even onto the 'factory floor'.  If your corporate culture leads you down a road where the guys packing boxes in your warehouse are being taken out in ambulances from heat exhaustion, then honestly I don't have high hopes for your powers of introspection. 0.9301460684992454\n",
      "82 : The unions almost stopped TPP--if they'd had more support they would have.  The unions need to do a better job of explaining their value.   Not just to union members but to all workers.  Unions need better marketing and better PR.  The right wing has been able to portray union workers as taking away from non-unionized workers.  Unions need to explain that it is the opposite--union efforts lead to better conditions, and wages, for everyone.  I've never been a union member but in my dining room I have a print depicting the Bread and Roses strike and I never forget that my 9:00 to 5:00 hours; my sick days, my vacation days, my unemployment insurance, all came through union actions.  0.9297306963478732\n",

      "87 : The most successful person I ever worked for was a First VP at a bank.  He made enough to retire early and is now running a couple of other businesses.<br/><br/>He was a tough guy to work for, he had very high standards and he expected them to be met.  He also paid each of his employees well above the minimums that the bank set for each position and he treated all of us well.<br/><br/>Turnover in his division was almost nonexistent and productivity was high.  Any one of us would have done anything in the world for him.<br/><br/>He's a millionaire and he gave me and several others our start in business.  I went on to earn six figures.<br/><br/>That's the way to run a business, not keeping people in indentured servitude and paying to continually train new employees. 0.929278827536207\n",
      "88 : Layoffs, while regretable, are a part of business.<br/><br/>I have been laid off before (twice).  I would have loved the opportunity to work three extra months while searching for my new job.  And on top of that, a 10% bonus also?  No brainer to take that offer.  Instead many are given just a few weeks pay.  Nobody forced these people to train their replacements.<br/><br/>I understand that losing your job can be very emotional.  My first time I had several wild emotions.  The second time I realized that the first time it was a new opportunity for me and it was easier to pick myself up and just move on.  I wish the Disney employees the best of luck and hope they all find situations in which they are much happier than they were before.  Hopefully they will be given the opportunity to learn new skills at their new jobs, as it is always important to try to make yourself as marketable as possible. 0.9292327981774682\n",
      "89 : Many people working 80 hour weeks do so because that is what the work requires in their position. If they do not, they will be replaced by someone who will work 80 hour weeks. The idea of the European 40 hour work week, or less, does not include management and a lot of white collar workers - never has.<br/><br/>And actually contrary to what you seem to be expressing, a good receptionist or office manager is actually MORE valuable and harder to replace than a bad manager or \"professional\", but that same good receptionist or office manager is also more valuable than a bad one or a rookie and deserves to be compensated for it rather than getting the same pay. 0.9288932748514293\n",

      "93 : Good article. <br/><br/>It is important to have open and honest policy discussions about how technology and work intersect. We will not roll back technology and the Promethean technology changes of late are here to stay. One question, as Mr. Gans notes, is “ ...the nature of work. Are people going to prefer a lifestyle that allows them to pick and choose more?”<br/><br/>Take Elance or Liberation Medical ( <a href=\"https://liberationmedical.com/\" title=\"https://liberationmedical.com/\" target=\"_blank\">https://liberationmedical.com/</a> ) as examples. These platforms allow technology and medical professionals, respectively, to work as independent contractors. This flexibility allows the professionals to choose the job, their pay rate and, in the case of Liberation Medical, the location of the work, allowing for much more freedom of choice.<br/><br/>Employers like these platforms because it allows them to utilize skilled labor as needed, without the often onerous, costly and burdensome commitments associated with a full-time hire or the pricey, exploitative and opaque nature of staffing companies.<br/><br/>Another issue with \"freelance\" and \"sharing\" economic models is exploitation. In the examples of Elance and Liberation Medical this is avoided because not only do the professionals choose the job, rates of pay and method of work, they are also in very high demand, and can easily find full-time work if they choose that route.<br/><br/>Other models, like Uber and TaskRabbit, are much more fraught with exploitation- the \"freelancers\" are really employees who are misclassified, as they do not choose the rate of pay. 0.928405384522862\n",
      "94 : Having worked for many years in highly competitive, long-hour, and demanding technology jobs on Wall Street and in high-tech companies, I can safely say that almost no one in those kinds of jobs work at Amazon, Apple, Goldman Sachs or similar companies because they have to. They do it because they want to. Maybe they want to build wealth, their resume, their skills, or for other opportunities.  Many leave for lighter duty over time -- but that's ok -- it's often their choice. Eventually I made that choice too and feel no remorse either for my current or past working life. <br/><br/>While the conditions may seem extreme (and every company has outliers of bad behavior and bad managers) -- the result is an ultra-competitve American company that I'm sure many Amazonians are proud to call their own.
